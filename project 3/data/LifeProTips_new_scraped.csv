Edit: Context. I have been work for a state University for almost 20 years. Still have loans. Have made payments for well over ten years after some years of deferral.  I tried to apply previously but due to the complexity would have been difficult to get to a point to qualify and the clock would have restarted and my payments to that point wouldn’t have qualified.

Edit two:  The take away is whether you just started or have been at a qualifying job for years now is the window to get everything qualified and processed during the waiver to get credit for whatever time you already have in service.

The truth is, we will always have to alter our old habits and routines to adapt to change.  If we become skillful at shifting into a new paradigm of thinking or way of performing tasks, we are at a great advantage in an ever changing world.

It boils down to embracing change, instead of resisting it.  Those that are comfortable in the unfamiliar have unlimited possibilities and potential.

Anyone that has learned a new language, particularly later in life, can attest to this idea.  When you learn a new language, you are not just learning a new set of words to express the same thoughts and emotions, you are learning about a whole new way to think and feel.  It's like unlocking a part of your brain that you never knew existed.

One of the hardest things to do is to change the way you do something, especially if you are very good at it and have been doing it for a long time.  It's not even always about getting better at the specific task at hand, but allowing yourself to learn a new way of doing something you familiar with.

The inspiration for this post was the example of typing on a QWERTY keyboard.  If one dares to try to learn a new keyboard layout, they will find it very (very) difficult.  Maybe they won't improve as a typist as a result, but the effort spent in changing how they perform a task so ingrained in the mind and muscle memory will be worth it.  It will exercise new parts of the brain and form new connections in brand new ways.  This is a paradigm shift, not just in the act of typing on a keyboard, but in the ways we think and learn.",2920,42,LifeProTips

ulspmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ulspmh/lpt_lestoil_is_amazing_for_getting_oil_stains_out/,LPT: Lestoil is AMAZING for getting oil stains out of clothes,"Listen up, I am the stain master. I can get almost any stain out and my secret is Lestoil. It's a degreasing solvent and i have used it in the past to get oil and bike grease out of my hands. Automotive mechanics use it too for the same reason. I get grease stains on my clothes sometimes, leaving chapstick in my pocket etc. The thing is this method works well even if you've already dried your clothes in the dryer and ""set"" the stain. This method is ironclad and invincible unlike the stupid baking soda and vinegar methods.


Step 1: Add a tsp of Lestoil on the stain and work it in with your fingers gently. You can add a few drips of water to help work it into a little lather (pro tip work it from both side of the fabric to help penetrate the solvent through. 

Step 2: Leave the garment the fuck alone for like 5 minutes to allow ample time for the Lestoil to absorb and cleave all the grease molecules. 

Step 3: Add a teaspoon amount of DAWN Dishsoap to the area and massage into a generous lather.

Step 4: Rinse or wash the area thoroughly and let air dry or throw it in a wash cycle and let dry. 10/10 times it will vastly reduce the grease/oil stain, and usually erases it completely.

 Sometimes if there's a slight bit left, just repeat the process as necessary. I have gotten the most heinous dried/set olive oil and chapstick stains out of shirts and pants through this way. There are no limitations and it's safe on everything I've ever used it on except for nubuck suede (will strip the water proofing layer and result in slight lightening of the boot). Also wouldn't recommend using it on waxed canvas bags either as that will strip the wax away.",105,33,LifeProTips

uls7lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/uls7lv/lpt_never_go_on_a_cruise_without_good_insurance/,LPT: Never go on a cruise without good insurance. Double and triple check that you are fully covered.,"If a cruise ship has to be diverted or a helicopter used to take a guest to land this can easily reach hundreds of thousands of pounds. If a guest didn’t have travel insurance they would be liable for this amount and the expenses could easily bankrupt a family.

In 2018 a family were cruising in the Caribbean with their child Kirsty. Kirsty felt a pain in her head and collapsed into the water. It was estimated that the cost of a medical evacuation to the United States would be $40,000-$50,000.

One night in the cruises medical clinic can cost you $11,000.

If you go on a cruise and don’t have travel insurance you risk losing your cruise fare, paying for large medical bills, and **being unable to get back home (repatriation)** in the event of an emergency. Many cruisers have been left with bills of **thousands of dollars** after a cruise due to not having adequate insurance.

If you are from a country that has a free national health service, or if you have a health insurance policy in a country like the USA this is usually **not valid** when on the ship. Medicare and the European Health Insurance Card **will not** cover you. Even if the cruise starts and finishes in a European port, and only visits European ports along the way, EHIC won’t cover passengers on a boat. This is because EHIC only covers people who are staying in a European country, not on a boat which travels between ports. Many passengers mistakenly believe that EHIC will cover them for trips, falls or illnesses which happen during one of the shore excursions, and again this is not the case, as the passengers “address” is still the ship.

Even if covid feels like it’s over to you or in your country, many countries still have hospitals that are struggelig to work at **pre-pandemic levels**. It can be vitally important to get you to your home country quickly.

The most common reason why insurance requests are denied is because of **undeclared medical conditions**. All illnesses, ongoing tests, and past conditions must be declared. Many examples of passengers who didn’t correctly disclose medical conditions (and as a result invalidated their insurance) can be found. General policies often does not cover anyone with a pre-existing medical condition.

There are many things that could become a medical emergency, even if you are in good health at the moment. Another guest on board the cruise could accidentally cause you harm (people are often drunk or stressed on board), a slip on one of the ships many staircases, a bacteria that makes you unwell in a foreign country.

The lower a food is on the GI, the lower the effect on your blood sugar. The standardized Glycemic Index ranges from 0 to 100.

Usually people only see calories in - calories out but they dont take into account the rate at which those calories are being used and burned.

Foods that have a high GI will be transformed and used at a faster rate by your body, if you dont use them really fast they will be transformed to fat. On the other hand foods with low GI will take substantially longer to be used up and the energy availability can be spread out for a longer time which results in you using the energy more often than not.

So we can argue that a chocolate bar with 150 calories is worse for weight loss than a 300 calorie bowl of rice.

You could put in hours and hours of practice and end up only digging yourself deeper into a hole.

Be aware of the right way to do things and put effort into getting better in that manner, even if it is harder at first. In the long run, unlearning something wrong takes much, much longer than learning something correctly once. Effective and focused practice is much more important than the amount of time you spend doing so. The person who practices a scale right 10 times is better at it than the person who practiced it wrong 1000 times

Edit: As many are saying, the phrase ""perfect practice makes perfect"" is similar to this. I personally use ""practice makes permanent"" instead as it emphasizes the potential for habits, good or bad, to become solidified.

Edit 2: I should clarify that mistakes are perfectly fine and even encouraged, as long as you can recognize them and take steps to improve them. Also, sucking is absolutely allowed; no one is good at something when they first try or will be able to do everything correctly in practice. The point of ""practice makes permanent"" is to warn against careless practice that may just end up being detrimental in the future if you let too many things slide. It's about identifying, preventing, or ""painting over"" bad habits to ensure you're spending your time effectively. When practicing, be conscious of what and how you are doing and take measures to ensure you are on the right track.

This isn’t a catch-all; there are some people deep in the throes of grief or existential woe and they might not be able to take care of a animal. For others, having a pet may provide physical touch, and studies have shown that receiving physical affection (i.e., cuddles and petting) has the same effect that a human touch would have. Many people also struggle with feeling purposeless & that they haven’t much to contribute or that their existence is meaningless. If an animal relies on you for food & shelter, it’s at least way less possible to feel purposeless, as another living creature relies on you to survive.

(or if you're the designated driver)","Many of us are expected to drink socially but may not want to. With friends, coworkers, bosses, family, at a wedding, whatever.

For those who don't know, ginger beer is basically VERY strong ginger ale.

1. Non alcoholic, like root beer.
2. Most bars carry it to use in Moscow mules. (comes in cans and bottles)
3. Significantly cheaper than alcohol so you're not ordering drinks that you barely touch for social acceptance.
4. It tastes good, burns a bit so you *feel* like you're drinking without actually drinking.
5. Many  times the ginger ale on the soda gun at a bar is set way too strong/syrupy to be a better mixer. (So ginger beer is way more reliable)
6. I personally drink ginger beer whenever invited to drink socially with friends (I'm a lightweight). And even keep some in the fridge as my ""beer"" when I get home. (Look in liquor section, not by soda)
7. Ginger is a mild stimulant, so it can perk you up if you need to be awake to drive friends home.
8. Bonus points if it comes in a glass bottle, avoids the subconscious feeling of being left out when all your friends have beers and you have a can of coke or something.

Edit:

After a very good comment from u/WarblingWalrusing, I feel I should clarify something. (That I also didn't realize on first posting)

Wisconsin drinking culture is very strong, and so drinking ginger beer, *for me personally,* is as much about wanting to not ""miss out"" or not feel apart from the group while out at the bars, as it is about avoiding people nagging you or asking constantly why you're not drinking. (Though that is a *big* part too) The ginger burn feels similar enough to vodka burn that you *feel* like you're drinking, but with no hangover. Most of the time I drink ginger beer, it's in place of drinking alcohol socially, so it keeps a similar sense of occasion.  ( I didn't realize until the guy made his comment, so there ya go.)

&#x200B;

Edit2:

I live in the lovely state of Wisconsin, which is the drunkest state in the U.S.. The drinking culture here is very strong and judging from comments, I think people give you considerably more shit here for not drinking than other places, which I didn't take into account.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I don't have a problem saying no to people's face when they try to get me to drink, but when that happens every 10-15 minutes over the span of 3 or 4 hours at a bar, it gets really damn annoying and it's easier to look like you're having a drink so people stop bugging you. (yes complete randoms will ask why you're at a bar not drinking. Don't ask me why, I don't understand it either.)

&#x200B;

Edit3:

I'm seeing a lot of ""this is dumb, just don't drink if you don't want to. Screw anyone for trying to pressure you into drinking"" comments. Which are valid.

I'm seeing equally many comments about how they have been nagged or even politely been asked (repeatedly by many people over the course of an event) why they're not drinking.

It's ok if this LPT doesn't work for you, I get that it doesn't pass the bar of ""holy shit this will improve my life dramatically"" but it's helped me and it seems from comments that some people really agree with it.

If you don't, that's fine. I'm not trying to say you're wrong for disagreeing. I'm just seeing an uncomfortable amount of comments in that vein that are less than polite with other commenters.

Edit4: commentator recommended not drinking ginger beer if you get heartburn easily. Best stick to mocktails.",1331,448,LifeProTips

I recently got hired at a new company that will pay me a lot more however as always with starting a new job I will be on probation and I do not like missing work at all during this period.

Normally I try to keep my car all fixed before something major like this however I do have an issue. I recently had to move house as I split with my partner in the span of 1 night and it did take a little tole on my savings.

I have about $390.00 in my more prominent savings for major bills and emergencies and $40 in my other savings account that I use for fun things.

Yesterday, I noticed that my front left car tire is very bald and the other day my car died after listing to music, without the engine, for under an hour. I had to call road service to jump my car and the tech said that my car battery is on its way out. I don't think I have changed my battery in the 4 years that I have had my current car. I am also needing to get a service which tends to bring more car repairs to light.

I would prefer to use the time I have left at the old job as I have a substancial amount of annual leave accrued and do this in one fat go however I don't have the money. The old company will pay out my annual leave which would be enough to knock all car stuff in one go but I won't get that until I start the new job.

I am rattling my brain on how to do this but I am thinking of doing the tires and a wheel alignment first, then getting a battery sorted once I have a little more money (I can call roadside again and ask for a technician with my battery type at any time of day) but that leaves the service. I am not sure how to service my car as most places are not open on Saturday and if they are then they are open for 4 hours that day.

What is your advice?

As soon as you know you are getting pulled over, immediately drive to the next SAFE place to stop and park. Your safety and the cops safety are priority number one. If it takes a little bit to find a safe part of the road or a parking lot, that is okay. I always try to get off the highway if I can. Go exactly the speed limit, they won't pull you over. But try to pull over in less than a minute.

When you stop, put down at least your window halfway to 3/4. If you have others in the car, put down their windows too. Turn off your car, put keys on dash and hands up on top of steering wheel. This again puts the cop at ease since you are signaling you aren't going to drive off. Get license and registration. Bonus points if you can have them ready before he gets to the window.

Be polite, honest, forgiving, accepting and most importantly do everything they say. It's okay to slightly embellish on where you are going and coming from to put them in your shoes. Stay calm through all that and when they walk back from their vehicle there's a good chance you'll have a warning; if you weren't doing anything too crazy. These steps have worked well for me during the past 20 years in Maryland and Virginia.

Very few friendships are ""love at first sight.""

For example, many adults after moving to a new city will at one point think to themselves, ""I keep trying to make new friends, but when we hang out, it's so awkward! Even if I think they're cool, it's just not the same as hanging out with \[name of old friend from hometown\].""

When you see it written out, you realize how ridiculous this sounds. Yet I catch myself doing this all the time! The only way I've found to fight this bias is to force myself to remember the growing pains of my old friend group. My old friend group feels so established now that I've blocked out the memories of us awkwardly getting to know each other. But forcing myself to remember in detail of how much time and effort it took for me to get comfortable with my friends helps me be patient getting to know people now.

I also enjoy asking people how they met their close friends.

Social anxiety is KILLER for events like this, especially when they are happening so often and with so many people. Below I'll have a few tips that have helped me with my anxiety. As a preface to all of this, your results will vary. While stuff listed works for me it may not work for you, so don't take this as gospel. 

1. Eat a healthy, non-gas causing, protein dense meal approximately 1-2 hours before the event. 
   
A. Protein is a long burn energy, it takes longer to digest and will keep you more stably energized throughout the whole event rather than carbs which have the potential to make you crash ([Source](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/overview-of-nutrition/carbohydrates,-proteins,-and-fats#:~:text=Because%20proteins%20are%20complex%20molecules,There%20are%2020%20amino%20acids))
   
B. eating 1-2 hours in advance is to allow your glucose levels to return to normal. Eating spikes your glucose which causes elevated heart rate and potentially addition anxiety.  [Source](https://www.knowdiabetes.org.uk/blog/those-bothersome-blood-sugar-spikes-after-meals/#:~:text=Why%20do%20people%20get%20blood,working%20to%20lower%20the%20spike) 
   
C. the non-gas is obvious...

2. Arrive early enough to be part of the initial crowd, but don't be so early that you are the first arriver. 
   
A. Having a smaller crowd helps alleviate some of the stress since there's fewer people (duh). Try chatting with a few people and see if you can get engaged in enough to pass the time. If you're invested in the conversation while the crowd is building up, it is possible that you'll be less stressed since you already feel comfortable with someone there and have been comfortable there the entire time. 
   
B. being the first arriver can still spike anxiety since you are now alone with a bunch of people who might not have been ready for people to show up yet. 

3. Drive yourself to the event if at all possible. If not, make sure you have a way to reliably escape 
   
A. your friend that carpooled you there probably doesn't have the same social battery as you. Chances are they will want to leave either early (pulling you out of the situation you did enjoy) or stay longer (keeping you in a drained state when you want to be home).

4. Lastly, it's ok to say no sometimes. You don't need to go to every event you are invited to and you owe nobody your time.

[Negative opinions dismissing nurses as low class or low importance are obviously wrong and disgusting, but the doctor's role does carry an additional social prestige which is the core idea here]

Not a lot of people knew what to do, who to call, how to help.

Sure, I wrote stuff on a whiteboard but that gets messy after a bit. Now that I'll be living on my own, I felt it was necessary to make this manual. 

Maybe the manual will help when I'm spiraling but I see it as a tool when others want to help but don't know how. Some people, for example, think calling the cops is always the immediate response. For me personally, if the cops were called and showed, I'd probably panick and fight. 

In my manual, it would explain the true and only reasons to call the police (I don't have to get into that) and what signs attributed to that call. 

To further bat this home, due to my conditions, I have bouts of suicide. No, I am not suicidal, but when I am crashing or stuck in auto pilot, sometimes I say creepy things. Someone could jump the gun and think, SHIT, Ares2890 is gonna kill himself. No, no-no. Based on my therapy and my long standing relationship with trauma, saying that with suicide in it or involved comes from a stress, fight or flight response. 

Never meant to write this much, but what I am saying is if you love yourself and want to always stay healthy, make a guide, manual, general tips even, on how to help you get through your moment of darkness. 

We all deserve help and deserve to receive help we feel is right. Be an advocate for yourself and make this booklet for yourself. When you man or woman comes over, friend, family, your in tears panicking, shits broken, they want to help save you - you point them to the booklet. 

Don't let anyone see this willy nilly, this is personal, only tell people you trust. Because when you write this you are not writing 'when I am sad' or 'when I feel lonely', you could but remember emergency.

Ares2890 said he wanted to kill himself, now what
Ares2890 is crying and circling back to the same thought like he is stuck on it
Ares2890 melted down 
Ares2890 talks about suicide

You should approach life with a long term plan for finding two ends of the rainbow: the first one is to build a life where you can enjoy relationships that are built on respect. The second one is to find your Ikigai.

**LIFE**

Kindergarten, school and college are opportunities to learn social skills, to establish healthy boundaries and to start developing a “*spidey sense*” that you will use to weed out toxic people out of your life, and that you will use to funnel people with a good head on their shoulders, whom you can nurture a relationship with. Life is too short to spend being bitter or resentful, so you should learn to avoid toxic persons pre-emptively, before they can do any harm to you.

If you don’t know how to recognise a good friend, here are some *green flags* to look for. The reverse of the medal is that you also have to look in the mirror, and ask yourself what you need to allow in your life to fit [the description](https://medium.com/@clusters_insp/the-guide-to-setting-healthy-boundaries-1ec789528788):

* Trust
* Accountability
* Safety
* Honesty
* Support
* Cooperation

Had I had this concept spelled out to me in bold letters at an early age, I would had dared more and experienced more. I feel I might sometimes have let my insecurities and my self-consciousness allow me to miss out on some parts of life. But at the same time, I am happy where I am now, and I would not have ended up here if I had made different choices. You live and learn, but it’s better to learn from the mistakes of others than to learn from your own.

**WORK**

Ikigai is a Japanese philosophy that suggests that you will [find your true purpose](https://studygram.me/blog/how-to-choose-your-college-major-according-to-the-japanese-philosophy-ikigai) when you find an occupation that ticks these four boxes. It looks much deeper than simply *following your passion* or""*following your dream*:

* You are good at it
* You actually enjoy doing it
* The world needs it
* You can make a living out of it

It is quite a conundrum to figure out at an early age what you want to do in life. I picked studies that were already a niche, so I had to work hard to get a career, but fortune smiles on me and within 8 years I landed the job I had always dreamed about. Although, I hadn’t considered that it came with a glass ceiling.

So if I could speak to a younger version of me, I would recommend to choose studies that could still land me in that field, but that had a broader reach and opened slightly more possibilities, horizontally but also vertically.

I think that having relationships that are built on respect, beats having a work that you enjoy, hands down. If you have to prioritise between the two, good relationships will make you more grounded in your life, and it can be enough to pull you through a mediocre job.

Inversely, having mediocre relationships will probably make you feel mediocre emotionally, even if you landed your dream job. You will be tempted to put all your value in the job, but the fact remains that a career is something that you can loose overnight. If you have fulfilling relationships, it means your friends value and respect you for who you are, and that cannot easily be lost overnight.

I think if you keep these two chart in mind, chase relationships that are built on mutual respect and search for your Ikigai, your life will NOT feel like it is missing something.",29,7,LifeProTips

Similarly, time blindness is also a sensory impairment.

Some of us may have some anxiety or fear about aging into our older decades.

In my line of work as a medical doctor, I meet many folks who are in their 70s to 80s. All have varying levels of health and functioning. A few ""exceptional"" ones that stand out to me are happy, healthy, and highly functioning.

I started asking these individuals and couples for their ""secrets"" of aging well. These were their most common advice:

1. They take good care of their brain and their bodies and have developed or learned habits to continue this for all of their lives. They sleep as much as they can, they nourish themselves well, they still learn things, and most of all, they spend time having fun or enjoying being present in their surroundings.
2. They don't neglect their most important relationships (typically long-term marriages or long-term partnerships). The ones with long-term relationships are still having sex with one another and eye each other with joy and glee when they ask for a Viagra prescription. They tend to make each other smile and laugh, even during a short office visit.
3. Not all of them exercise, but all of them have reasons to keep moving their bodies. These are usually jobs and/or hobbies that keep their bodies moving in positions other than the usual sitting or standing or laying down during most of their waking moments.
4. Most common and most important of all, they wake up each morning with a sense of purpose, or duty to a service, that they are passionate about, even after they retire. They never stop serving their partners, their family members, or their communities.

May you all advance into your 70s to 80s with as much functioning and enjoyment out of life as possible!

Much Love

For example: I am worried about how I will have to organize my wedding in the future, or if a relative of mine dies, how should I organize the funeral?... After a while learning about with these worries, I realized that the reason I worry so much is because **I don't know how things work**. For example, when I go to work, I don't know what I have to do that day, and I always have to ask my colleagues or my superiors what I have to do today (which makes me very uncomfortable), or with events like organizing weddings or funerals (things that might happen in the future), I'm also worried that I won't do well because I've never had any experience with these things, and I'm afraid that I will make a mistake and make everyone laugh.

 I thought for a long time to minimize my anxiety about not knowing how things work, but to no avail. And so I worry even more. Does anyone have experience with this problem? I look forward to everyone's help. Sincere thanks.

Sometimes people open up to you about their problems because they want to get it off their chest, and sometimes they just want someone to assure or comfort them. So don’t jump straight to giving them advice as that might not be what they want to hear and might make them feel worse. 

They decided to tell their problems to you because they trust you and hope that in doing so, their problem becomes less of a problem.

Growing your own veggies can be quite rewarding, and can help alleviate stress and anxiety through interacting with your plants. Starting your own garden can be difficult, and many give up either because it takes too much time out of their day or they dont think they have a green thumb, or just end up killing everything they touch. However, I do think that anyone can grow their own food if they know where to start. 

some veggies grow from seed, like peppers, egg plants, and broccoli. These plants can be a bit more difficult to grow for beginners because you have to pay close attention to the seedlings and have to be careful with transplanting them, which can result in root shock if youre not careful. As you may have guessed, there are some veggies that are easier to grow, and require less attention, and dont always require seeds to grow, and these are the root veggies. 

Root veggies are veggies where the main portion that is consumed is located inside the soil and is integrated in to the plants root system. These veggies include potatoes, onions, garlic, beets, carrots. There are many other, but Ill focus on these for now. 

for potatoes, garlic, and onions, you can buy the bulbs/tubers from your local garden center, and from there you simply prep the soil and stick them in. Potatoes and onions can be harvested in about 2-3 months, while garlic is usually planted just before september and then harvested in late spring. For carrots and beets, all you have to do is create mounds in the soil, and place the seeds on the mounds. Beet and carrots seeds are not as finicky as other plants are, so they are easier to grow, in my opinion.",26,11,LifeProTips

Different scenarios with other people can bring up negative emotions and reactions within us, but that's usually because we're stuck in our own little world. A good way to balance your thoughts and feelings is to mentally switch roles between yourself and the other party and see if you're being reasonable or not.  So for the different examples above:

* Mad at your friend for flaking:
   * Imagine you flaked on your friend, do you feel malicious or hateful when you do it? Or are you lazy/forgetful/imperfect
* Anxious in a social setting:
   * If one of the people around you tripped up their worlds once or twice or isn't the pinnacle of charisma, are you constatly judging them and putting them down in your head? Probably not, you wouldn't care or even notice, so assume others wouldn't too
* You could be overreacting about something
   * If you were the one who did that thing to the other person, would you consider your reaction reasonable?
* Worried that guests won't like your food
   * If you're a guest in someone's house and the food is, at worst, mediocre or even bad, would you judge them negatively, look down on them, or dislike them, or appreciate the effort they've gone to and recognize that things sometimes go wrong.

The point is that since we're so self absorbed in our own lives, it's easy to constantly turn every little thing into something much bigger. I feel like that's why people who are generally working towards  goals that are big or challenging  tend to be more laid back since their ego is pointed outwards instead of inwards.

Also, even though my examples were meant to minimize negative emotions we tend to perceive, it doesn't mean that there won't be situtations where our emotions are completely justified like if we face situations with blatant injustice. This trick is still reliable though because our inner moral compass will tend to feel shitty if we imagine ourselves wronging the other party so it can still be used as a litmus test.",50,5,LifeProTips

uepchl,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/uepchl/lpt_if_you_take_your_kids_somewhere_public_where/,"LPT: If you take your kids somewhere public where they could conceivably get lost, be prepared.","1. Choose their clothes carefully. Multiple kids wearing matching outfits is very cute but a nightmare when only one of them is lost and staff are trying to look for them. If you must match, try for different colors of the same item or different clothes styles in the same fabric (dress and overalls, for instance). Don't rely on accessories that may fall off to differentiate between kids. Edit to clarify, based on comments: this tip is about *removing or reducing ambiguity* so staff can quickly identify which child is missing and convey the information to other staff. If a staff member hears over their radio to look for a kid in an Elsa dress and sees a child in an Elsa dress with an adult (aka, your other child wearing a matching outfit, standing with you while your other kid is missing), they may either disregard the call thinking the kid has been found or think that this child in an Elsa dress is not supposed to be with that adult. Conveying information about the parent missing a child is not always standard procedure, especially because of point 4. 

2. Before you leave the house or as soon into your excursion as you can, take a photo of your kid. If they get lost, it's a lot easier to show a staff member a photo than to try to remember exactly what your kid is wearing. Staff will also be better able to pull the exact info they need to make an announcement from a photo. 

3. Prepare your kids for the possibility of getting separated. When you arrive at your destination, find a meet up spot where everyone can go if they get separated. Show your children what staff members are wearing and where they can be found if they need help. Make sure your kids (mainly age 4+) know what you look like and who they're there with. Most 4 year olds should be able to at least tell staff their grownup's first name, hair color and length, and any accessories they usually have on (glasses, backpack, hat, hijab, etc). 

4. If your kid does get separated from you, try to stay calm and ask a staff member for help and ask what you can do. If you tell a staff member your kid is lost and then run off to look for them, staff will have a hard time finding you to give you any updates. Tell the staff member any additional info that may help them find or communicate with your kid (they're Deaf, they're nonverbal, they don't speak English, they may be with another kid, etc) 

5. *If you're there with another adult, communicate with the other adult(s) in your party to make sure the kid isn't with them.*

Between having both business and personal cellphones and the waiting around that happens at convention hotels between checkouts and flights I often had slightly absurd numbers of phones turned in to my office all at once.

""Its an iPhone, in a black case, with a (came-with-the-phone lockscreen image) """"Yeah, I have three of those""""It's really chewed up on the corners?""""Were down to two!""

Use a photo you took- a rock (mine is a lava field), a flower, your favorite shoes, the toe beans of your cat, someone elses' cat- something unique that you can describe to me and I can see matches what you're telling me. Then I can definitively say YES, I have your phone, what's the best way to get it back to you?

if you're really bad about losing your phone, write out an ""if found, call ##### or email soandso@address subject 'found phone'."" and use that photo as your lock screen.

Edit: I see a lot of people didn't read the ""help patrons not on the property anymore"". This tip work when you don't know where your phone is and you're calling places to see if you left it there.

This works because if you hold your hands still in front of the blower, only part of them gets hit directly by the air, causing that part to dry and nowhere else.

It’s a lot easier to bar yourself from doing more work and then getting excited to add to your routine. 

What worked for me (and many friends/family that have followed) is to focus first on spending a full hour ***every day*** in the gym. For the first couple weeks, only let yourself use the treadmill… start off walking, but make sure you spend the full hour in the gym ***every single day.***

It may feel silly to go to the gym and not sweat, but I promise that if you’re consistent this will work. 

After a couple days you’ll probably notice that you want to do a little more than just walk for an hour… maybe you start challenging yourself see how many miles you can fit into the hour. 

Eventually (once the hour EVERY DAY) becomes part of your normal routine, you’ll find yourself actively wanting to try other exercises to fill up your gym time, ***and it will be enjoyable.***

Start will the lowest weights you can. It will feel silly to bench press 5-10lb dumbbells at first, but again… you’ll find yourself wanting the additional challenge later. 

Then you might start challenging yourself to eat better, as to not ruin all the work you’ve been putting in at the gym. 

6-8 weeks in and your body will start to show progress, whether or not you’ve started your journey to lifting (which is the end goal). 

You can do it. Get started. Stay consistent. Your physical, and more importantly, mental health will thank you for it.

Edit: Don’t care what you say. My advice revolves around THE GYM. Going physically to THE GYM. The space is important.

Edit 2: A lot of “um ackchewally” comments followed with how they are ***attempting*** to get past their fitness struggles… 
Again, this method is tried and true. If you have aspirational fitness goals, you will figure out the rest after you have this solid habit formed (or as you’re forming it). Don’t tell me “this may work for some” while you aren’t fit at all or are struggling to get there. ***If*** you can make it to the gym for an hour a day—this method *will* work.

Final edit: For those of you who are gym rats—try and remember how hard it was for you to start (unless you are an athlete, which kind of forces the habit to start). When I was a gym rat before Covid, I remember thinking to myself wtf all these people need to just start it’s so easy to be consistent and fit. But looking back on it, I remember how many times I tried to start and failed, until I just did this. And this is what I did to get back in shape over the last several months. The hardest part is just getting started and staying consistent.",27344,1495,LifeProTips

Forward to 4 months ago, when 2 things happened simultaneously. My bank locked me out of my account, because my Federal Name didn't match what was on the account, and my Driver's License needed to be renewed. I found that I couldn't renew it until I changed my name Federally. Social Security explained what documents I needed, including a valid, current ID. Which I couldn't get without my name being changed with Social Security.

Add to all this that my Social Security Office isn't open to the public still, (unless it's an immigration issue), and I had to do all of this via the phone, (3 hours on hold, each time, on average), or online. It was such a nightmare, (including my puppy chewing up my Legal Copy of my Marriage Certificate), that could have been avoided, had I just changed my name with Social Security right after I got married.

I ended up getting a signed note from my Dr, stating that I am in fact, me, along with the rest of my paperwork. I also learned that Social Security will accept a signed Dr's note, verifying your identity.

It doesn't mean they've genuinely changed. The kind of change where they become the type of person who would never do that thing again under any circumstance requires an understanding of the pain it's caused and the empathy to never want to inflict it ever again.

So if you cut off ties with a friend due to asshole behavior and they apologize to get back in your good graces, be wary that they may not have necessarily changed. They may just hate being lonely more than being an asshole. If so, they'll regress back to the behavior in a consequence free scenario, i.e. with someone they aren't friends with.

A corollary to this is that they may also simply become more subtle and street-wise about doing the condemnable thing now that they know you won't put up with it. 

And while I would not venture to say that you shouldn't tell people what they've done wrong when they ask why you're upset with them - those are murky waters I myself have not fully explored - this is why people figuring out why you're upset themselves thought and reflection is a much stronger indicator of true change. It means they've put themselves in your shoes and examined their actions through your eyes. 

In telling them however, you cant be sure if you haven't simply informed them of what you will and will not tolerate, leading them to simply see it as a stipulation for avoiding conflict with you and looking for ways to maneuver around it.

I bought some furniture with a 0% interest for 2 years promotion. The catch on all of these types of promotions is that if you don’t pay it off before the promotion expires you get hit with all the interest accrued since you made the purchase. The real interest rate is always some ungodly number you dont pay attention to when you are enticed by a promotion like this. I figured I would make 24 equal payments and take advantage of this promotion and it seemed so easy. So i set up my autopay which showed me that if I paid the minimum payment, which happened to be my total divided by 24 exactly then I would pay off this loan before the promotion expired. Great. So I set my autopay to ‘minimum payment’ and proceeded to forget all about this loan for the next two years. I am guessing that some of you already know where I fucked up. So I’m a busy guy I have a family and my credit card bill is usually very long and I tend not to keep track of repeating payments if I think that I’ve already got them all squared away. What I didn’t notice was that over time the ‘minimum payment’ for this loan was decreasing. So when 24 months had passed I had not in fact paid off this loan. I didn’t realize this. I had completely forgotten how many months had gone by. I knew in the back of my head this loan should be expiring soon so the next email statement I received i actually opened it (which I never do). I was flabbergasted to see not only was the loan not almost paid off but my balance had increased by over $2500. I had passed the 24 month mark and since the loan was not paid off I was hit with all of the interest. What I should’ve done when I set up my auto pay was to specifically type in how much I wanted to pay each month. Selecting ‘minimum balance’ screwed me. Now, I was very fortunate As I caught my fuck up within 30 days of the date when the interest hit my account. I was able to negotiate with the bank to pay off my loan without all of that additional interest. If I hadn’t noticed within 30 days I would’ve been on the hook for it all.",13,3,LifeProTips

INTO.SALES!!,"The younger you are, the better! Live at your parents so you can weather the occasional bad month? Even better. Sales is inarguably the quickest way to make the most money from an entry level perspective when joining a company. What’s even better, you can parlay this level of earnings into better positions with more guaranteed pay down the road. Once you’ve established that level of earnings. For example, if you make 75k (salary + commission) on a sales job that pays $30k salary, you could start looking for the next job that offers $75k salary plus commissions. Or a job that doesn’t involve sales at all, but you now have the experience and W2 (American version of tax slip confirming annual earnings) to negotiate that level of salary. 

To any of you reading thinking “But I hate sales.” Or “I could never sell anything.” More than likely, what you hate is the “perception” of what you think a sales person is. Are there some people who are slimy stereotypical “car salesman”? Of course. But really how you should approach sales is identifying what a customer’s problem is and how you could resolve that problem with your product/service. And if you can demonstrate some ROI (return on investment) with your solution, be it financial or other means, to that customer? Perfection. That should even be part of your pitch when meeting with clients - “I don’t really have much interest trying to “sell” you anything, but if you give me a list of your pain points as a business, I’d love to see if we could help fix some of your issues with our products.” 

How to get hired? 
Sales is unique in that you really don’t need to have any tangible skills, you just need to be able to communicate. In any interview setting (again, this is geared towards entry level - some sales jobs can be very technical and require several levels of experience) be sure to hit on the following points when describing yourself:

You’re a head hunter - you get a thrill chasing down new business.
You’re a team player - you’ll do whatever is asked, a collection of ideas is always better than just your own. 
You have an insatiable thirst for learning - of your product, of the sales process, of human nature and people in general. You are very coachable and welcome critique, as you feel it will only help you become a better sales person (which means more money!)

How do you make a sale?
It really comes down to three easy questions:
What are your pain points/ reasons for us meeting today? (*If lead given appointment, not pounding pavement generating new business). 

Who all is involved in the decision process? If they mention anyone other than themself, ask when that person would be available to ensure you’re all on the same page (This helps you identify who will actually be signing the check , so you don’t waste time on middle men with no real actual decision making ability). 

What is your budget and timeline for this project? This helps you quantify the opportunity. 

Can sales be hard? 
YES! Full stop. People will waste your time, give your business away at the last minute, and occasionally lie to your face. But you know what else can be hard? Literally every other job, with a fraction of the pay, and no room for advancement. It’s not for everyone BUT everyone can do it. So if you aren’t happy with your current earnings, what do you have to lose?

There are countless vertical markets that hire entry level sales positions. Nothing in life is guaranteed, but if you hit on the points above in the interview, and keep those three questions in mind on every sales call, there’s a strong chance you will get the job and do well! Good luck and go get em!

It took me a longer than I’d like to admit that I wasn’t doing a great of job searching. As I near 40 and now do hiring and team management myself, I’ve learned lessons from both sides of the experience. While your mileage may vary for your individual career path, a lot of this advice is generalize and can be resized to fit. Feel free to pick and choose whatever you find useful, but I can say with some confidence that all of this has helped me have a very cool, diverse career for the past 15 years.

**Define yourself and your career narrative**: Everything else follows from this. Who are you? What do you want to do next? We can all better define the narrative of our career and that takes practice and refinement.

One of the most disappointing interviews of my career was an early post-grad interview where the interviewer straight up told me that she couldn't make sense of my story. Sure, I studied a lot and could possibly do a lot of things, but I was so disordered in my self-story that she just couldn't figure out what I'd be able to do for her team.

Don't be me. Define your narrative. What does that mean? Simply put, it means being able to say succinctly who you are and what you bring. For instance in my case: ""I'm a partnerships leader who helps run teams who develop new partnerships, lead deal negotiations, and serve as the organizational glue between internal and external stakeholders."" I obviously provide more, but for what I do that gets me the first five minutes of attention.

The more you practice defining yourself and your story the more confident you will be. There is no shame in introspection.

**Resumes are tricky, so don't hesitate to get yours scrutinized:** Resumes suck. They all suck. They're a way oversimplified distillation of everything you do, but they're often the first look someone has at who you are. Make sure your resume speaks to your narrative of who you are, but most importantly: DON'T LEAVE ANY TYPOS. You have no idea how many resumes I've reviewed with obvious glaring typos. Please, don't do that.

**Make your public persona shine:** I realize that not everyone is on LinkedIn, but everyone has an online presence to some degree now. I STRONGLY recommend having a high-quality LinkedIn profile if you are applying to any “office-type” job. I look at the LinkedIn profiles of everyone I interview and look for any additional context about that person compared to their resume. I don’t think everyone needs to have the best LinkedIn profile ever, but don’t skimp on having your LinkedIn tell a consistent story about who you are and what you’re capable of doing. Trust me, both recruiters and hiring manager will pay attention. And please make your photo flattering-- if you can, pay for a professional headshot. Worst case it becomes your Slack icon.

**Practice interviewing with alumni or friends with more work experience:** Most colleges/universities provide at least some access to alumni who are willing to help mentor you in your career. Take advantage of that and do mock interviews. Tons of them. Get feedback, be humbled and take the time to be introspective as you get feedback. Not all of it will be equally helpful, but treat it like you would any other interview and hear out the mock interviewer and their feedback for you. One fun bit of advice I got early? Stop biting my cuticles in interviews. Yep. That was a fun one to get. And since then I've learned to apply some hydrocortisone to my fingertips that are peeling so I have less of an urge to nibble. Little things, eh?

**Please don't slack off with recruiters:** Recruiter screens might seem like a formality but they're really not. Recruiters can be your best advocate or they can push to have you nixed early. They are an important first and last step in the process. Do NOT think they're simply there to read your resume and ask questions. They often help the hiring manager from start to finish and can have tons of power over your hiring process.

**There is no perfect job, there is only the right job for right now:** I have worked for some of the coolest, best-known companies on Earth. And I've left every one of them at some point. There is no perfect job, no perfect boss, no perfect role. Don't think that because you didn't get something this time that you are any less worthy. I got told multiple times at one job that I wasn't a people manager. I now manage people. I've been told I wasn't a partnership manager. I'm now a director-level partnerships manager. I've been told I don't know how to manage software lifecycle. I now help manage huge gaming franchise lifecycles.

Above all: it's just a job. No job will ever be perfect, and it's okay to not get it right now. There's always another job.

Good luck-- keep at it!",126,13,LifeProTips

* The date of her last doctors appt.
* Doctors name
* What the Doctor said
* What tests the Doctor ran
* What the results were (and I brought copies of the results and the physical results from tests. IE X-rays or CDs with MRIs.

* Any medications provided and what the results were.

This helped in 2 ways. It gave them a very quick idea of what was going on and it let them know they are going on this list so they should take the time to give us proper care.

The first two numbers affect overall width. Those two numbers are the Lens Diameter (how wide each lens is across), and the Bridge Width (The space that sits upon your nose).

NOTE - This does not include your pupillary distance, which is required when ordering glasses online but not included with your prescription information.

To measure your PD:

* Place a mm ruler up against your eyes, resting it on the bridge of your nose.
* Line up the starting point (0 mm) with your left (or right) pupil. This measurement is only accurate if you are looking straight ahead.
* Look at yourself in the mirror or have someone else read the ruler. If someone else is reading the ruler they must be at the same height as you.

ubjomt,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ubjomt/lpt_school_ended_for_the_year_and_you_are/,LPT: School ended for the year and you are applying for summer jobs? A few words of advice from HR.," Looking for a summer job this year? Here are a few words of advice.

If you come in person to interview or just to get an application, dress nice. Not saying you need a suit and tie to apply for a lifeguard position, but wear decent pants and a nicer shirt (ie: a polo shirt), not ripped jeans and a dirty ""420 YOLO SWAG"" shirt.

When you are talking to people look them in the eyes and engage them. I can't tell you how many people come in to apply for a job and look at their shoes the entire time and mumble responses to my questions.

Make sure your application is readable. I have shit for hand writing but when I was filling out applications it looked like I got an A+ in hand writing class. If I can't read it, I won't hire you. On the same vein, answer ALL the questions. Don't leave half the application blank and expect anyone to call you back.

Put the cell phone away. If you are waiting for someone that is fine, but when someone is talking to you put it away and don't bring it out again until you leave.

If you have questions about hiring, the position, or if there is any word on your application make sure that it is you that is calling, not mom or dad. It is a sign of maturity and that you are responsible enough to follow up yourself. It is a huge red flag if mom is calling me every day to ask questions for you or to push me to give you a job.

source: I do HR at a decent size country club and have been doing the hiring for the last few years and have reviewed more than enough terrible applications and candidates.

Will add some extra good advice as well:

\*Use a blue or black pen to fill out an application.

\*Don't bring friends with you to apply.

\*Have a professional email address, not [fingerbanger666@gmail.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130523070931/mailto:fingerbanger666@gmail.com)

\*If possible hand an application to the manager not an employee.

\*Don't show up when we are running around like mad people expecting anyone to talk to you or remember you.

\*Don't apply too early (we forget about the application) or too late. Try and think of a reasonable time to apply, sorry it is vague advice.

\*Don't be late and don't have a poor excuse.

\*Know how to shake someone's hand.

\*Be confident when you are applying in person.

\*Be polite!",11,20,LifeProTips

One day he tried heating his up the next morning and about 2 bites in declared to the world ""okay, heated up McDonalds is officially BAD"". 

I took this declaration as gospel because he was older and cooler than me. I lived by those words for twenty years and they were etched into my brain as a Rule of the Land, spoken by a wise man in my formative years.

As time went on and I experienced life as a broke college student I got more conscious about wasting food and would occasionally give it a try. Maybe they'd changed their recipe. Maybe the fries just needed more salt. Nope, heated up McDonalds was, still, officially BAD. I'd mentally kick myself for questioning the Holy Gospel until the next time my empty wallet got the better of me. 

Until yesterday. I stumbled across a life hack, nothing complicated, nothing special. Just one line.

""You can save heated up McDonalds if you put it in the microwave with half a mug of water, it'll come out crispy"".

By chance my partner's mom had gotten a discount family meal at McDonalds just that night and I had a burger and half a bag of fries in the fridge I was ready to test my luck with. Today was the day. Everything I thought I knew about the world was on the line. I put my burger and fries on a plate, filled half a mug with water and placed it in the center. 50 seconds. Would the law finally be broken? Would this forever change the rule of the land?

I sat down and took a bite. Took another few bites to be sure. And I have to say I've reached a disappointing verdict, the law still holds true. It is BAD.

So my question is, is there any way to salvage heated up McDonalds? Did I fuck up the mug trick somehow? Or is this just a tried and true fact of life I need to truly accept after 23 years?",0,16,LifeProTips

It may be hard to tell the difference between a legitimate debt collector and a fake one. Sometimes a fake collector may even have some of your personal information, like a bank account number. A caller may be a fake debt collector if he:

•is seeking payment on a debt for a loan you do not recognize;

•refuses to give you a mailing address or phone number;

•asks you for personal financial or sensitive information; or

•exerts high pressure to try to scare you into paying, such as threatening to have you arrested or to report you to a law enforcement agency.

If you think that a caller may be a fake debt collector:

•Ask the caller for his name, company, street address, and telephone number. Tell the caller that you refuse to discuss any debt until you get a written ""validation notice."" The notice must include the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor you owe, and your rights under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

If a caller refuses to give you all of this information, do not pay! Paying a fake debt collector will not always make them go away. They may make up another debt to try to get more money from you.

•Stop speaking with the caller. If you have the caller's address, send a letter demanding that the caller stop contacting you, and keep a copy for your files. By law, real debt collectors must stop calling you if you ask them to in writing.

•Do not give the caller personal financial or other sensitive information. Never give out or confirm personal financial or other sensitive information like your bank account, credit card, or Social Security number unless you know whom you're dealing with. Scam artists, like fake debt collectors, can use your information to commit identity theft – charging your existing credit cards, opening new credit card, checking, or savings accounts, writing fraudulent checks, or taking out loans in your name.

•Contact your creditor. If the debt is legitimate – but you think the collector may not be – contact your creditor about the calls. Share the information you have about the suspicious calls and find out who, if anyone, the creditor has authorized to collect the debt.

•Report the call. Contact the FTC and your state Attorney General's office with information about suspicious callers. Many states have their own debt collection laws in addition to the federal FDCPA. Your Attorney General's office can help you determine your rights under your state's law.",11,2,LifeProTips

How the rich avoid taxes is they basically take loans from banks on the basis of their assets like house, stocks, gold etc. They don’t sell any of these assets to generate cash flow because selling any of these will come with tax implication. So they keep these invested as it is and take out loans on them to run their life. No tax to be paid on loans and they get huge tax exemptions as well. This is what everyone should be doing, not only the financially literate. 

If you have a house that is paid up for, you should definitely take out a loan on it and invest the cash in stocks or business etc. Don’t leave an asset idle without making money out of it. And the assets like stocks, house or Gold appreciate in value so most of the times the interest you need to pay to the bank is more than offset by your asset appreciation itself. Don’t be in a hurry to re-pay the bank. The game is to pull out as much money from banks that can be given to you and use that effectively more than the interest of the banks. 

Of course most important is the loan you take should not be used to buy stupid things that depreciate like a car or fancy phones or watches etc. You can afford this to an extent but your asset needs to appreciate even more in that case to compensate for these expenditures. 

For people in the US if your student loan has the highest interest rate than bank loan rates then of course this is not applicable to you since best use of any additional cash flow for you guys will be to pay off the highest interest loan like the student loan you may have.",1,11,LifeProTips

Ok so it's been pointed out to me that I did a rather poor job of articulating the distinction between assessment & judgement:

Assessment is valuable. ""This is how I responded to X at Y time, Z would have been a more appropriate way of going about it.""  
  
Judgement is more ""I am so stupid that I did X instead of Z when Y.""

Assessment is valuable & necessary. Judgement can be (and often is) harmful & counterproductive.",569,20,LifeProTips

Basically, the majority of jobs that are out there are not a good fit for you, and the majority of the ones that are sort of in your area aren't that good or are hard to get into due to promotions getting positions with tons of applicants and such. 

So, basically 10-20% of the jobs that look like you'd like are going to be actually good fits. Most of the other ones are kind of a waste of time.

Basically, that best match the following criteria:

* Few applicants.
* Does the job sound enjoyable?
* Is the pay decent or likely decent?
* Does the company do something you'd want to do?
* Could you talk more comfortably about the job/relate experiences naturally in an interview?

I've applied for very few jobs in my life and I have had several at this point, and this is the method I use.

I hope this helps you as well as employers, because someone who applies for jobs that are well suited for them will also be better employees. It's win-win to be a good fit - your employer makes more money off of you, and your performance is naturally better. You're also more likely to get the jobs you apply to by doing this.

This isn't the only technique, but it's perhaps the most important to being able to actually more easily write a cover letter.

Here's a project plan for finding a job as a bonus:

1. Spend a couple days just getting your resume in shape. Sleep on it, do it again. Make sure it's clear and descriptive and actually showcases your abilities and anecdotes.
2. Save 30-50 jobs on a job site like LinkedIn or Indeed. This might take an hour to find 30 that are decent.
3. Pick the top few out of that 30-50.
4. Write a cover letter for the top job out of those few. This might take a little while as well to get the first cover letter in good shape. Subsequent ones will be much easier.
5. Save that cover letter as a template for future cover letters.
6. Apply for that top job with the catered cover letter and resume.
7. Use the catered resume and cover letter as templates for the next one.",0,5,LifeProTips

As a someone that has reviewed hundreds of resumes and hired or rejected a lot, I would like to share the tips from a hiring manager pov. One of the most important thing that surprises me is the lack of candidates understanding of their own resume. 
 
Understand YOUR Resume

Your resume represents YOU and answers some of the questions before you show up for an interview but not all. Resume preparation is of utmost importance at all time.
Who      :  It tells me your name along with any contact details.
What     :  It tells me what your role was and the responsibilities that came with it.
When    :  It tells me the time period of your previous jobs. Your total job experience or if you are entry level
Where :  It tells me where you worked prior to this interview.
 
WHY and HOW are the two things that the resume WILL NOT answer and THAT’S what the interview will be for. 
 
Understand YOUR Interview

While I know what you did, I do not know why you did it or how you did it. 
 
The WHY tells me your passion for the profession.  There is nothing wrong in exploring multiple career choices before you settle for the one you love or pays the most. Ideally your passion should pay the most.  But lets be realistic. So how adaptable are you? The energy you show in your answers to the interview question, tells me how passionate you are.  This one is a hit or miss.  Some candidates are quiet in their way but extremely passionate and it doesn’t show in the interview.  They end up doing a great job. Some candidates jump up and down in the interview but become grumpy after hiring them.  But please understand that energy levels are important in an interview.  Hiring managers take time of their work to sit in a conference room to talk to people they have only met through a resume.  There was a reason your resume got picked up.  You interview should match your resume or exceed it to be memorable among the many candidates. Keep in mind that in all the time it takes to find the candidate, the position continues to be empty and the work is done by others that might not be qualified to do.  
 
The HOW tells me if you are a team player.  Someone that engages others in getting a task done or is a solo act.  Nothing wrong with either.  Depends on how you present it. The HOW also answers me your threshold for risk taking and your understanding of the best use of time and resources. I will be looking to understand you more as a person and your learning curve.  Do you need a lot of hand holding or can you hit the road running.

Conclusion 
 
This tip is a tip of the iceberg.  There is a lot more to this so doing appropriate research helps quite a bit. There are also people far more qualified that can give even better suggestions. So take help if needed. 
 
I wish you all the success and hope this helped in a little way.
 
TLDR;   Treat your resume as an extension of YOU.  It answers some questions but not all. Make sure you put in the effort to understand your resume thoroughly. Attend interview confidently. Practice interviewing in front of a mirror if it helps.",24,4,LifeProTips

Allow yourself to feel your feelings, and your load will become lighter.","I preface this by saying everyone's grief is unique, and not all advice fits for every situation. That said, one of the biggest and most common mistakes I see when it comes to loss is denying the loss and the grief that comes with it.

What is grief? Grief is the intense physical and emotional response we experience when we lose something important. We most commonly think of grief as happening when we lose someone to death, but grief is common in many other situations. You will need to grieve when you fail at a dream, when someone you trust lets you down, when your understanding of the world is flawed, when a friend becomes unavailable, or there is a negative change in your life you cannot control. Sometimes, when I get very happy, I cry because I am grieving the fact I have not experienced that kind of happiness in a long time. Grief is weird. But it is a part of the human experience. 

We cannot control grief. Grief is a natural biological reaction to a dramatic change in our life. We cannot control our biology, rather, we evolved grief as a survival mechanism. Yes, grief actually helps us to thrive. When we deny our grief, it has numerous negative effects. It makes us miserable. It makes us angry at the world. It separates us from reality, and from connecting with our friends and family. It forces you to continue looking at the world from an old point of view, a framework which doesn't hold anymore given new evidence. When we deny our grief, we stay stuck in the past, not truly engaging in reality, but instead engaging with an old framework our subconscious knows is flawed. Instead of letting go and finding a new path forward, if we deny grief, we get angry at the world for not fitting our flawed framework. It's an unwinnable position, as the world will continue to disappoint us. 

Grief must be allowed space. If it is telling you to be sad, set aside time to cry. If it is telling you to be angry, find a pillow to shout into and a mattress to hit. When you engage your grief, saying everything that comes to mind without judgement. It doesn't matter if it makes sense. It doesn't matter if it is fair. Just get the poison of that old broken framework out. Seek out the company of loved ones. Talk about your grief with them. Get as much physical touch, like hugs, and arms around your shoulder, as you can. Grief may never completely leave you, but if you make space for it, it will leave you for a period and give you the space to move on. When we grieve, we recognize parts of the grief we no longer need to carry with us, and it gets lighter. Likewise, when we openly engage our emotions, we get stronger and more comfortable engaging them in the future. And the more we share with others, the less we have to carry on our own. 

**TL;DR** If you have experienced loss, you should try to take time to grieve. It doesn't have to be immediately after the loss. Sometimes we must continue to fight until we reach a safe place. But when we get to a safe place, and when those feelings start to well up, don't push them down. Allow yourself to ugly cry, allow yourself to yell into a pillow, and allow yourself to say everything you need to say to process, and give yourself space to grow and change.",92,6,LifeProTips

uaeawo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/uaeawo/lpt_how_to_form_a_habit/,LPT: How to form a habit,"
(personal summary of book „atomic habits“. I recommend reading it)



# Step 0: Make it simple

Clearly define the habit you’re trying to form. Define it so precisely that a computer could start and end the habit. For example: Don’t plan to read every day. Plan to read every day at exactly 22:00 for exactly 15 minutes. Use a timer to always stop after 15 minutes.

If you notice that you missed your habit sometimes, don’t write it off as that you simply missed it. Adjust your habit routine so that you don’t need to do it at times you can’t / don‘t want to do it. This helps because you never miss a habit with this procedure and it tells yourself that you execute your habits seriously.

Don’t waste too much time planning a habit though. *“Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.”*


# Step 1: Make it obvious

Use the first part of the habit loop “cue, craving, response, reward”

Create one or more cues for you to remember to execute your habit. “The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues”

### Examples:

- Create a reminder on your phone
- Make utensils for your habits visible and put them in the way of other things
- Link your habits to other habits you already have (habit stacking)
- Talk with others about your habit, this gives you social pressure to keep your habit going
- Prepare part of your habit beforehand


# Step 2: Make it attractive

For the second part of the habit loop to work, you need to make a habit attractive. This means that you look forward to doing it.

This can be achieved as follows:

### **Mix your habit with something you want to do.**

A television show encouraged their viewers to eat popcorn and drink wine white watching the show. This made them associate the show with something positive.

Be careful while implementing something similar yourself. The action may be conflicting with the identity you try to create with the habit. (Like eating ice cream after training)

**Examples from the book:**

1. After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I’m grateful for that happened yesterday (need).
2. After I say one thing I’m grateful for, I will read the news (want).
3. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).
4. After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).

(note: wtf is a burpee?)

### Assume a new identity and join a club

*“You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run.”* 


# Step 3: Make it easy

The best way to build a habit is repetition and the best way to learn is to practice, not to plan. Habits will get easier and will require less brain power the more you do it. The number of repetitions are more important than the length of one repetition for automation.

## Remove points of friction

One way of making a habit easier is to lighten the cognitive load. You can do this with priming your environment. That means making preparations and removing obstacles beforehand.

Create an environment where doing the right thing is the easier choice.


## Ritualize the beginning of a process

When trying to form a new habit but facing difficulties to keep your routine, try the two minutes rule:

Plan your habits so that they only take two minutes and make your habit very easy to start.

*“As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely a hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak performance”*

## Preparing one-time actions

*“Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.”*


# Step 4: make it satisfying

*”What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided”*

## Track your progress

Seeing your progress is immensely satisfying and makes you not want to quit. Visual forms of measurement are some of the best ways to show progress. Some examples for tracking progress:

- Habit Tracker
- Making an X on a calendar for every completed set of a habit
- Seeing the page number go up after reading

## Never miss twice

It’s okay to miss your habit one time, no one’s perfect. It is however every important to take the habit back up as fast as possible. For that the rule „never miss twice“ is beneficial.

## Stop when satisfying

Don’t put in more work and time in a habit than you plan. Preferably stop before your fully satisfied. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good”


# How to break a habit

1. Make it invisible
    1. Put your phone outside your room when going to bed
    2. Hide things associated with a habit
2. Make it unattractive
    1. Highlight the problems / benefits from avoiding the habits
    2. Associate your habit with something negative
3. Make it difficult
    1. Increase the steps needed for a habit to start
        1. Take out batteries out of tv remote 
    2. Create a commitment device, restrict your choices to the favorable ones 
4. Make it unsatisfying
    1. Ask someone to watch your behavior
    2. Create a habit contract, make your bad habits public and painful.

Assuming you follow these basic (and easy) steps, two things will happen:

1. **Either**, you drink the water, but sleep afterwards.... (no problems) the water will soon wake you up as your urge to pee increases, thereby acting as a ""natural alarm"" if you will. In this case you're still waking up relatively on time.
2. **Or**, you drink the water, and in the process your body wakes up, as the water acts as a natural source to make you feel refreshed.

Either way, this simple DIY hack can help build the habit of waking up on time. Also, **bonus tip:** start with an easy target, if you have been waking up at 10AM, then perhaps start this water routine with say, 9:15AM or 9:30AM.... plus, this whole life hack is a double edged sword, as drinking water right out of bed is itself considered a very good habit.

I just promoted a top employee and they are really good at their job. My only reservation with further promotion is their social behavior especially when challenged. 

This person does not seem capable of calm discussion when confronting another opinion or perspective. Their reaction is usually defensive and assumes a bunker mentality. “I must not lose and they must not win”. Usually it becomes very uncomfortable in the room. 

This has caused some embarrassment with customers or business partners for me as I am left to defend the outcome. 

This works in my personal life as well but don’t say anything in response right away. Take a breathe and ask questions about the other viewpoint and go from there.

Reheating pizza with an oven doesn’t even come close.,"This is a hill I will die on. Heat your pizza up in the microwave until the cheese becomes melted and bread becomes soft (about 30-60 seconds per slice). The grease will usually make the bread slightly soggy, which is what you want to happen. Separately, heat up a pan on high heat until hot and place the microwaved pizza in the pan for about 30-60 seconds until the crust becomes stiff/slightly crispy. The grease helps this process, so no need to add anything on the surface of the pan. Use a spatula to remove the pizza from the pan. If it’s a high quality pizza it will taste exactly the same as when it was first made. If it’s a low quality pizza it will taste better than when it was first made. 

If you leave the slice in the pan for too long you’ll harden the bread, dry out the sauce, burn the cheese and ruin your experience. Be sure to move the pan around the stove top burner because the center of the pan will have the most heat and you want to make the bread and crust of the pizza cook evenly and achieve equal crispiness.",0,29,LifeProTips

It is natural to feel anxious, angry, sad, etc. on certain things or past events. Over thinking about a certain negative event that makes you bothered can lead to an overall reduction in productivity and generally just ruins your entire day. But **there is a solution** to this in my opinion.

# WHAT TO DO:

1. Take out a sheet of paper and pen (no, don't use your electronic devices, just plain and simple paper would do)
2. Write down your emotions, the storyline, a background of the event, or literally whatever comes to your mind. In other words, have a full fledged ranting session out for the paper, and don't leave any details out. 
3. After writing, just read the whole thing in your mind.... I would recommend you read it just once and fully. 
4. After reading, just tear the paper into tiny pieces and throw it away.

# LEARNING:

In my personal opinion, my overall mood improves a lot after this exercise and my focus on my work improves. Your mind needs an opening to rant it out, and a paper and pen are the most patient friends to rant to. Throwing and tearing the paper afterwards is a symbol of 'moving on'. 

# CONCLUSION

Spending 10 mins on this method is much better than ruining 10 hours. Maybe give it a try and see what happens. For me, this was a game changer.

1. First secure all your identifiers so that call rep can identify you thru their system fast
2. Prep your phone convo agenda: the reason of why you call, what you know and situation you are in, what you think you know so that clarification can be made, what you are confused about and not aware, your assumption on this matter, and previously acquired facts ans etc. Make it into 6 points bullet point agenda so that call rep can assess your situation quick. 
3. Have a large paper, smooth pen, and clipboard so that you can gather as much info as possible
4. Keep calm, friendly, and on-point. Call reps are humans and just like all of us, they do not know everything and follow manual and have limited authority. To get help, be polite. Do not be a Karen just because you cannot see them. They can transfer you around as retaliation. 
5. Get the call reps name, reference number to follow up as needed. 
6. Make a summary report on info you acquired to facilitate your next course of action: file them. 
7. Go for a walk to decompress. Phone call can be daunting.
8. Confirm and double confirm!
9. Make sure you have phone in quiet area. Make sure no one interrupts you. Anyone who interrupts you in having important call: consider them to be your archnemesis for next 3 minutes. Seriously, who talks to you when someone is having phone conversation??",12,3,LifeProTips

Do NOT take the person's word for it, even if it's more than one person, do NOT trust caller ID, etc.

&#x200B;

* If you receive a call/text about one of your accounts having fraudulent activity, go to the source completely on your own and check.  (Log in by typing the URL yourself).  Do NOT click links in an email, in a text, etc.  Do NOT provide your pin, password, etc.  Even though the caller ID may show your bank name, do NOT assume that it is your bank calling.
* If you receive an email, you can often hover over the sender and see the real sender address first.  These can still be spoofed, so remember to always go to the URL yourself and do not use links.  Close and reopen the browser and log into your credit card, Amazon, wherever and look.  Find customer support on your own and call THAT number.
* *Real* customer service and fraud departments have zero problems with you hanging up and calling back, such as calling the number on the back of your credit card, going to the website to report, etc.  They may recommend, but will not pressure you into taking immediate action.  Nothing is THAT urgent where you cannot spare a few minutes.
* There are a great deal of scams centered around Amazon, Apple, Medicare, Account Services, Credit Cards/Banks, IRS, Social Security, Car Warranties, Vacations, online romance, utilities, craigslist, rentals, LinkedIn job applications, Venmo/Zelle/PayPal/gift cards.
* As much as I do not want to say it, based on experience, many scam callers will have an Indian accent.  Scams may often have you press a number before proceeding, like press 1 (just hang up instead of pressing anything).
* Fake checks are often used for scams.  Checks can take MONTHS to fully clear, especially if they are international.  Just because your bank cashes a check and makes money available in your account does NOT mean a cash is checked.  Anyone asking you to cash a check or 'accidentally' sending more money and asking you to send it back, or make a purchase from a particular business/website, is very likely a scam.

  
These people pray on fear and desperation; Fear of missing out or fear of missing a great opportunity.  If something is too good to be true, even an online shopping price, it very likely is.  Ask yourself if saving a few bucks is worth it.

Always, always, always, validate the person is not a scammer.  Granddaughter supposedly in jail or in trouble and asking you to send money right away?  Hang up, give her a call and text and just wait.  You do NOT want to lose your identity or life savings because you gave out the wrong info.  After being scammed, most real businesses will NOT refund your money because it generally stands that ***you willingly sent money to scammers*****.**  


Most importantly, TALK TO YOUR FAMILY ABOUT THIS, *especially the elderly*.  Remember to frequently check your credit card, etc. for fraudulent activity.

it makes it real

it makes the other options sound better

it reminds you both that this partner and their love is finite and deserves work.

&#x200B;

Edit for clarification: this should be brought up in a safe and productive manner. 

some examples might be ""i think its important that we figure this out, it seems so small when you compare it to a divorce, and i know we can fix this if we tried""

or the analytical approach (which is what i prefer) 1. this is the problem 2. this is how important it is to me. 3. what are alternatives? we do X, maybe we think of a way to Y instead, maybe we can avoid it entirely by Z, or of course theres always divorce which is stupid, so lets avoid that one.  
be sure that your partner knows this isnt what you want (unless you do want it).

and dont ever give your partner ultimatums. ""do this or ill divorce you"" divorce isnt the only option, it isnt the ultimatum option, its just the very last option that we should recognize together as a team, in order to avoid it.

if you find yourself arguing with your partner, stop, and find a way to discuss instead. emotions help find truth, but they rarely help find answers.

\-do i really need to worry about a boutonniere and corsage? all of the floral places havent been accepting any for like 3 weeks. i can easily diy one but ?? should i stress this?

\- my date isnt wearing a suit or a tux, just a black dress shirt and a bowtie. this is okay right? there isnt a prom dress code

\-what do i do for ""preprom""? im nervous because we arent going to any school things and things are being worked out with his mom at the moment, and if it is the typical, go to his house and take photos with parents there, from your experience, is it stressful or awkward??

\- are the little adhesive covers for boobs uncomfortable??

\-do i need to bring anything else besides my phone and if so, where do i put it?

\-what should i do about jewelry? i dont care much and thought of wearing a nice little chain but i dont want to be too basic or anything/? idk i literally thrifted my dress for 1.50 at the local thriftstore (fits perfect btw) so i dont mind too much about things obviously but still yk?

\-are painted nails acceptable instead of actually getting them done or should i get fake ones to put on?

If something happens to your pet, the consequences can be devastating. Accidents always happen when you least expect them, this goes for your pets as well. Recently a relatively old cat from our neighbors passed away and the hospital where he blew out his final breath had a ton of questions they hadn't expected.

When something does happen to your pet, the follow hours often become an emotional roller-coaster. Animal hospitals will ask you all sorts of questions but your thought is only going to be with the animal on the bed. The chances of you coming up with a rational, non-emotional answer are pretty slim, yet you have to decide the fate of your pet relatively quickly.

It's always better to be prepared for these kind of questions in advance, so you can focus on the recovery (or in worst case) grieving period. Even though it can be really hard, write down answers for questions like:

* What if he/she gets a tumor? At what cost and on what age/state of being do you decide not to operate?
* If your pet dies, do you want it preserved by means of taxidermy? Do you want to take them home or leave them at the hospital? Does your local law allow burial in the back yard?
* In what condition will you decide to let the pet go and prevent the suffering?

Not having to answer these kinds of questions heavily emotional on the spot might save you a lot of trouble (and sometimes, money as well).",7,5,LifeProTips

When you need a contractor for a home construction, repair or lawn job, be sure to contact the contractors for quotes directly from the Google business listings. I use Google Maps.

It's a lucrative business and Angi is the biggest of the lead generators, and the closest these guys can get to a code of business ethics- which isn't much. When you become a lead, be prepared for your phone to ring constantly for weeks, as well as your number being instantly sold by unethical lead generators to scammers, generating months of headaches until you can re-register for the Federal Do Not Call List- and even then it often doesn't help, because most scammer leads are sold overseas.",6,2,LifeProTips

It's amazing to see how your brain can process your choice of action over the 24 hours. When the emotions settle, you think more cognitively and can decide responsibly without the influence of your strong emotions from the initial creation of your idea.

edit: Apparently I have periodontal disease, which is more severe than gingivitis. It's characterized by your gums bleeding every time you brush your teeth, and a bad-smelling emission coming from your gums. Regular gingivitis probably won't have that many extra bacteria present, so you shouldn't have to worry about it spreading to the rest of your gums.

The normal wash places are always closed, and the auto wash places don't have good value for my money.

First, I go to one of those self-spray car wash places. These offer amazing band for your buck. You control how much time you want, and which features to use.

The minimum charge at the one I use is $1.25. This gives me about four minutes of wash time. If I were to try to use all the functions, I'd never make it because it takes so much time to get around the car. So here are the two features I use:

* High Pressure Wash.
* High Pressure Wax.

When you bucket wash, you'll pre-rinse as a prep, as wetted dirt and grime sticks less. But If you go through drive-thru car washes, you'll find that some don't bother with a pre-rinse cycle. They immediately soap the car down. The high pressure wash is essentially doing both at the same time. Use this to your adavantage. Be sure to spray the bottom and wheel wells, and you'll be fine.

The high pressure wax easily has enough pressure to rinse the soap off. So I use this to rinse and give the car a nice sheen afterward.

Now, if my bosses complained, I would find another option, but I have developed a reputation of keeping the car in such good shape when I come in, that my bosses don't bother to inspect them. ""We trust you, Saxon. You always bring the car in clean.""

This is far faster, far cheaper, and a lot less dull than using a drive thru. The water is always kept a little warmer than usual, probably to protect the pipes from freezing in the winter, and the long wand makes it difficult to get myself wet anyway.

Now, if your car is positively filthy, this technique probably won't serve your purposes. It'll take too long, and you won't have enough time to make use of all the needed attributes.

But I have a clean car, done quickly, and is clean enough to keep me in top standing in my chauffeur's position.",4658,228,LifeProTips
