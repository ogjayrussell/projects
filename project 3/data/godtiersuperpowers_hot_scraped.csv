* It doesn't have to be a human being, anything organic goes: dogs or cats, a tiger with a good temper, a unicorn or a mermaid, as well as absolutely bizarre creatures (their bodies need to be functional though, so your mermaid needs a perfectly reasonable way to breath underwater and your tiger needs as much meat as tigers need to stay alive)
* People didn't particularly like me setting an ethical handicap on them in my previous superpower, and fair enough, but surely we can agree that creating a perfect ever-young immortal girlfriend who only desires you, lives to please you and can't live without you is really mean, especially once you are dead by 2027",37,3,godtiersuperpowers

So pretty much, as the title states, you can buy whatever you want. But it's not just with money. You can ""use"" yourself to buy it, literally. You want a girl/boyfriend? You can decide what you want to lose in your life, can be breaking a bone or losing your best friend etc and you get it. Want money? You'll get it somehow, where it's through a gift or winning the lottery etc, doesn't matter how, you'll get it. You can buy whatever you want with whatever you want. 

The catches are that you don't know what will be taken or how much will be taken and the power has a cool down time period of a week. It's effectively a wish you pay for. And it has to be within ""humanly"" limits. Say you can't trade lives with someone entirely but you can have aspects of it. The price to pay of course will be enormous.

Any and all rest will be done instantly when asleep, and dream immortality is granted (you can’t die in your sleep unless it’s due to natural causes). 

Every perceived 12 hours worth of training within this dream state is equal to one level.

You can figure out how to make magic if your smart enough (roughly level 2000 intelligence), and you can also access this irl, but to a lesser degree.

Simulated combat is also possible, but the pain is doubled and will cause you to wake up after 12 consecutive deaths within your dream state as well as worsen your mental health, intelligence, charisma, and wisdom stats.

Luck stat can also be raised by playing Russian Roulette with 5 bullets in a 6 shot revolver, (amount of bullets can be lowered with higher wisdom)

Stats that can be raised:

Dexterity, Strength, Vitality, Agility, Flexibility, Resilience, Charisma, Wisdom, Intelligence, Battle Intelligence, Mental Fortitude (scales with wisdom), Perception, Performance, and Luck.

All base stats start at 10.

Have fun.

There is also different types of species of animals so turn dogs into cats

Here is the list of things you can do with this power

Transform your hand into a head by changing what type of body part it is,then change what kind of species the head is and turn it into a lion,
Congrats you have a lion head as your hand now

Turn acid into regular water by changing what type of liquid it is,

Heck of you think about it there is different types of matter,you can turn something solid into gas vaporising it, and you can turn the air around you which is a gas into water,

You can change what type of species you are into a species of organism that reproduce asexually (and no you would not lose your human intelligence I know it doesn't really make sense,but the powers won't be fun if you somehow lose your intelligence when transforming into a less intelligent life from ) and after that you reproduce into two different version of that organism,,, turn you and that other organism you produced back to humans making a clone,change what type of gender the clone of yours have and, hehehehhehe 

I mean heck you can turn into any species you want,wanna turn into a small insect fly in the air then turn into a giant elephant,you can do that!

And of aliens exist well might as well be Ben 10 and change yourself into them

Also remember that you don't need to change your entire body,you can also choose to only change someparts of it,meaning that you can make 2 or more parts of your body different species, and you can also transform change types of body part you can transform all of your limbs into head,then transform all of the heads into different species of animal alien, and become an eldritch horror entity

Come to think of it there is various different position and direction and if something has a Variation you can change it,

You can change the different variations of position you're at,and make yourself teleport,

You can also be a budget accelerator by changing what type direction something moves towards allowing you to reflect attacks coming at you,

Oh and there is different types of energy

If someone tries to hit you you can convert all of the kinetic energy of their punch into light energy paralyzing them and make their hands glow instead,

Copy photosynthesis by changing the light energy from the sun into food energy for your body

Heck with this ability you're immune to basically any attack by just turning the energy of those attacks into a harmless types of energy like the food energy (energy you get from food)

Kinetic energy from physical attack be it melee or projectile,turn the energy into other types of energy to stop the movement before it reaches you,heat and electricity is a type of energy too,

Change what type of weather is happening,change the weather to raining then transform all of the rain water into acid by changing what type of liquid it is

And finally at higher level since there is various different possibilities event or actions that can happen and you can manipulate Variation you can manipulate events,if there is different variations of alternate universe or timelines you can change it,into one another,",23,4,godtiersuperpowers

Falling over implies from a standing position to laying down, no matter how, getting shoved or knocked down counts, but as soon as you fly in the air it is not considered falling over, but falling. 
You have to leave the ground for at least 0.5secs before this applies.

It also doesn't protect you from harm, so it will prevent damage from the falling over, but won't protect from glass shards, lava, spikes or the like.

Interaction is something that occurs when one things have an effect on the other,

Interaction manipulation allows you to make something or someone to interact with something as if it was a different thing entirely

For example you can interact with the floor around around you as if they are water and swim in it,you can also interact with stone walls as if it's made of paper and easily tear through it,

""What makes this ability different from transmutation? I mean I can just transmute the walls into paper""

Well the difference is that if you transmute a wall into paper you and everyone else can tear it easily,however on tha other hand if you change interaction manipulation makes it so that the wall is soft like paper only to you,other people would still feel it as a regular hard stone,

Another example is with fire,

If fire touches water it will be extinguished 
If a fire touches oil it will become bigger,amplified

But with this ability you can switch it up
You can make it so that fire actually dissapear when touching oil and be stronger when touching water instead,

You can also make two objects interact with each other the same way two completely different object interact with one another

You can make a stone interact with air around it as if the stone was a fire and the air was water,and causing the air to extinguish the stone

This power have so MUCH potential and let me give you list of things I've come up with this

Interact with air below your feet as if it was solid ground and walk on air

Make your eye interact with a wall as if it was made of glass allowing you to see through it, alternatively you can also make light interact with said walls as if it was a glass allowing light to pass through it

Be immune and swim in acid by interacting with said acid as if they are regular water

Interact with any non breathable gas as if it was oxygen allowing you to survive and breath any gas even toxic or dangerous ones

Inetract with any object as if it was allowing you to eat non edible items

Interact with heavy objects as if they are made out of light material allowing you to easily carry them

Make bullets interact with air around you as if the air is made out of bullet proof material
Making an invisible barrier around you 

You can make you and any object you don't want near you,like a projectile interact with each other as if they are the same magnet field 

You can interact with the world around you as if you're an animal like making your nose interact with smell the same way dog does,enhanced smell


You can interact with walls the same way light interacts with glass allowing you to phase through it

You can make two things interact with each other as of one of them is an antimatter creating an explosion

But interaction isn't always between two completely separate things

Sometimes interaction can happen between the components of one thing,

For example our body parts interact with each other,
Our brain interact with our limbs and control it
And some body parts like our eye interact with the brain by giving it information,

We can make our brain interact with objects around us like as TIF they are our body parts like making it interact with a pebble as if they are our eyes or ears allowing us to spy through it or making our brain interact with an object as if it was our hands and legs and move it with our mind basically telekinesis

But the most powerful ability of all,is the ability to interact with our environment and everything around it as if it was OUR IMAGINATION effectively allowing us to control everything to our liking and make our imagination into reality",65,15,godtiersuperpowers

The potential to use this ability is innate, but how strong it becomes depends on how much you hone it. 

The base ability is switching between male/female rudimentary thought patterns. Brains of the two sexes are wired differently, except you have the wiring of both and you choose which one processes your thoughts. Kind of like running the same program on different sets of CPU/RAM all part of one motherboard. 

The next is basic personality types, introverted/extroverted, easygoing/serious, mean/agreeable etc. Once you successfully empathize with someone of a different personality, you can create a profile that is semi conscious based on the feeling you related to. When you switch to this alternate, your ""real"" you goes into third person mode inside your brain. Controlling your body and thoughts will feel like controlling an RPG game character, you make executive decisions and have override ability but all the small, personal aspects of interactions become automatic. 

The advanced level of this ability is mixing and matching personality/character traits and creating custom presets. You can choose the amount of control you have over a profile currently in charge, from first person (simulated psychology and neurological differences) to third person RPG (you make choices and your body moves according to the character profile).  

It can get out of control, if you get hooked on living the experience of a problematic preset, such as a impulsive adrenaline junkie. Living in the brain of an adrenaline junkie is fun, you get extra highs but you might get hurt. Over time the real you sitting the in ""cockpit"" of your brain forgets it's there like a person forgetting he's in the VR world. Presets can be deleted and addictions can be manually cleansed, since addictions are a re wiring of your brain and you can do that manually.

Yours will actually work just fine.

* If you need to, say, wash the dishes, but you'd rather be playing PC, you can skip the time it takes to wash the dishes and an automated version of you will go through the motions instead. Physical time will pass, so if it takes 15 minutes to do the dishes, it will be 15 minutes later in the day.
* The automated version will not be pushing itself hard or overperforming, but it will be solid enough to do gym workouts for you on a lazy day.
* If you are using it to skip social events, it will do the bare minimum, whilst observing your personal interests.
* In case something happens during the skipping that requires your presence, you will be thrown a minute prior to that event. It can be something interesting that you might want to check out yourself or something important.
* Accidents cannot happen to you on autopilot. This can be exploited for safe driving, safe flights etc. but it doesn't extend much further than that. So you can't set your goal to ""Kill Putin"" and then take precisely the steps it would take to kill him without dying.

The second part of the power is the cherry on top and quite simple: you store the time it would take to finish the action you skipped and can use it to pause time later. So if you want to play PC but also need to clean the house, you can autopilot cleaning, store the time it took to do it and keep playing PC in the time freeze of the same duration.",642,20,godtiersuperpowers

First off, just for funsies, you have endless party tricks. No way someone is not impressed that you can ace a beer pong round, destroy at flip cup, balance a broomstick on your nose, guess the exact number of pages in a book, etc.

Second, endless bets you will always win. On both the giving and receiving end. Someone bets you that you can't throw a tennis ball into a car's exhaust pipe from 100 feet away for $1,000? Guess what, you nail that bitch. Also, let's say you put $10,000 on a 100:1 odds that you predict the exact march madness bracket, and guess what...you predict it with 100% accuracy.

You can become the best chef to ever pick up a knife. Cook a steak to utmost perfection. Combine flavors with in an exact ratio for optimal flavor. Combine new flavors in a way that is extremely enjoyable. Cook the most perfect omelette. The options are endless.

You can become the best professional athlete in any sport to ever play the game. Play 18 on every word-class golf course? No problem. Shoot 100% from the 3-point line for your entire career? Easy money. Bowl a 300 on every game? Done and Done.

Doesn't even apply to physical tasks. You can perfectly predict market trends, when to buy, when to sell, when to invest, and what company to invest in. You could not only make a fortune off that but also make a killing as a financial advisor. 

Take a crack at solving the intricacies of quantum mechanics. You'll nail it. Of course, you'll need a ton of relevant experience but guess what, everything you need to learn along the way you get perfectly right every time. No second try necessary. Take a crack at curing cancer, dementia, ALS, etc. As long as you walk the path of learning in hopes of making a difference, you'll accomplish it. 

Looking for love? You'll find your perfect compatible match. Might take some time but you'll find them.

You can predict with 100% accuracy the outcome of any event. Elections, natural disasters, moon exploding, when aliens make contact, etc.

Naturally, this power could be used for bad reasons. You could be the most deadly assassin to ever exist. Perfect marksmanship. The world's most successful general, being able to avoid capture every time, predicting tactics from enemies, taking the correct risks and succeeding every time. 

Not to mention craftsmanship. Take a stab at woodworking, you'll create the most perfect cabinet to ever exist. Want to design clothes? They'll fit more perfectly than you could have ever imagined. Be the most prolific and enigmatic painter to ever exist, you can paint exactly what you see and/or paint what your seeing within your mind perfectly. Art is subjective of course but whatever you attempt becomes the most perfect version of that.

I could go on and on. Feel free to add if you so desire. Truly the best superpower.

&#x200B;

Note: this power does not involve being able to do something perfectly on your first try without experience. The implication is that if you put in work and effort to learn and achieve something, you do so with astounding success and accuracy.

4. You can absorb people’s memory and skills, but you lose 5 years of life every time you do this.

5. You can either absorb people’ lifespans, killing them, but you’ll age as normal. Your death is also predetermined and you have quantum immortality until the date. (My new favorite word)

6. You can steal people’s bodies but you lose all memory of your life in your previous body. This is not a body swap, you are effectively killing them. You previous body also ‘dies’. #3 provides an exception to the memory loss, as you still keep the memory bank.

7. Hard reset on you life. You die and time travel back with no memory of your current life. Whatever ability you had active at the moment of death you have permanently. If you selected #2 it will only activate once you reach the age of 20

You can de-summon it at any time, your power up will be permanent but at the expense of not being able to summon that creature anymore, you can though renounce the power it gave you in order to be able to summon it again. You can conjure up to 20 creatures at the time and absorb up to 10 of them. But don't go around summoning a god to fight an ant as you won't be able to control creatures who are way too powerful. 

For example if you tried to summon Morpheus from Neil Gaiman's Sandman, you would be able to summon him but he wouldn't be under your control and he will inevitably act of his own will, you can neither absorb him and gain it's power since it's too immense. You can try to create a ladder to get to him though by absorbing other beings before him to try and create some sort of escalation through which he will no longer be completely unreachable, for example absorb some people like:

-Spider-man (Marvel)


-Superman (DC comics)


-Son Goku (Dragon ball)


-Saitama (One punch man)


-Gold Experience Requiem (JJBA)


-Dr Manhattan (Watchmen)


-Darkseid in it's raw form (DC comics)


-Perpetua (DC comics)


-Convoluted Batman/Joker hybrid who defeated perpetua (DC comics)


-Dream of the Endless (DC comics)


(Yes I'm kind of a fan of DC comics in case you didn't notice)



Anyway if the difference is still too great (and I would guess it would be for certain beings like Dream), then you would face the consequences like the wrath of a God like him. If you separate yourself even from a being on which the chain is formed the whole ladder will consequently collapse. Every being with whom you separate is instantly summoned and needs to be de-summoned. Beings that are summoned which are more powerful than you could escape your control and act of their own volition just like Dream of the Endless would. So for example to control someone like Superman you'll need to be at least as strong and resilient as Spider-man and so on. Their will could also overlap your control so for example if you summon both Superman and Lex Luthor their hate could end up breaking your control over them and they might end up fighting against each other, this also makes keeping strong willed beings under your control fairly difficult if you aren't powerful enough.
You can also gain the physical appearance of any being you decide to absorb and their intelligence and knowledge too, these will be lost if you separate, in any way your ego remains intact during the process. You will gain the sum of the powers of the beings you decide to absorb so you'll get exponentially more powerful after each one of them. You can only summon a single version of each being so no absorbing multiple Supermen for example. 

For a fictional creature to be eligible for being summoned it needs to be a part of a story which at least a hundred other people have read or heard or seen. And yes, you can also bring back dead people even though this opens a whole can of ""should I just because I can"" kind of stuff and ""would they be the same even if they have the same memories, experiences and even the same fricking soul"". You sort the morals and ethical issues of that one. 



>!Ok I'd say this is OP enough to be god tier and not too powerful to get boring,it opens up a lot of possibilities like ""superhero showdowns"" where you could for example summon two entities and make them fight each other and gain a ton of money that way by becoming a bloodthirsty grandmaster like the one from Thor Ragnarok, heck you could enslave humanity in a day with this kind of power and create basically Sakaar.!<!

Some features I had in mind:","* From the get-go, you get a notes/notification system. Where you can ""write down"" your thoughts and have constant access to them. Your own personal alarm clock, reminders etc.
* After upgrading to level 10, if you are not yet there (an average person is level 10-12), starts showing you what quests you need to take to increase your skills and the likelihood that the quest will increase your skills.
* At level 11, you get access to the Internet
* At level 12 you get a personalized adviser that shows, among other things, that a certain action increases or decreases a certain stat. e.g. getting drunk will temporarily debuff 20% of motor skills, and semi-permanently decrease brain power by 0.01% etc.
* At level 13, when you are officially above average, you get the first overall upgrade to your adviser:

1. It comes with the best up-to-date guidance on how to increase your skills, what actions are advisable to take right now, where are you making obvious mistakes. For example, it can show you that to increase your overall well-being, a 20-minute nap would be advisable. How often do we forget to take a nap unless a personal adviser tells us to?
2. It now takes your emotional condition into account when judging your stats at the moment. Getting motivated buffs your stats. Vice versa, sometimes you are feeling down, so you get a ""mood debuff"". Every stat now comes with a little explanation for the scoring system, your skillset potential is approximated, i.e. showing that, for example, your guitar playing skill is ≈20% (100% being an absolute genius, and 0% being an unteachable moron) A reasonable potential for an upgrade is 20% within 3 months.

* At level 14, you can invest level-up points into skill trees which you have not developed. For example, you can invest your point towards playing the violin, and if you have never played it before, your initial progress will be 300% quicker than that of a talented kid.
* At level 15, the deterioration of skills with time when unused gets significantly reduced. Now you can learn Japanese, never speak a single Japanese word for the next year, and come back to exactly that same place
* At level 16, you get three points for each level up
* At level 20 (black belt at Jiu-Jitsu, PhD from Ivy League, that sort of thing, so level 20 is quite a challenge) you get 20 additional points to invest for free wherever you want (notice that at this point increasing your level gets easier, as you get so many boosters already, but milestones of particular skills might become harder to achieve unless you invest and specialize)

You will also get features that are unlocked when a particular skill level is achieved and skills unlocked when particular questlines are finished.

For particular skills:

* Compassion skill, level 20. You can now see other people's levels. This feature gets better and better the more you progress. With time, you can check not only their levels but their stats. Then you can check the levels and stats of any person - not necessarily the one you see irl.
* Rationality skill, level 20. Biases warning: The system warns you that your current thinking process is flawed and shows what kind of fallacy you are committing.
* Mathematics, level 15 (Bachelor in Math approximately): you get a fairly advanced calculator in your mind. At level 20 you can draw graphs and visualize shapes, stats etc. in your mind.
* Perseverance/Hard work skill, level 20. The adviser uses everything it knows about you to motivate you perfectly at any given moment (via music, advice, word of encouragement etc.)
* Intersocial skill, level 20. Gives you suggestions on what to say, how to persuade, fool, seduce or threaten someone (with different approaches working or not depending on how often you use them).
* Martial arts, level 20 (probably like 5-7 years of continuous training for a normal person to reach this level) you get reads on your opponents fighting stats, weak points and strategy advice.

For particular quests (many of them will be hidden, unknown to you):

* ""Doctor House"". Opens once you become a doctor. You are now granted the power to see symptoms of illnesses, possible causes, and ways to treat them.
* This one will be hidden. Risking your life to save another human being grants you second life in case some lethal accident happens. You will be restored with full HP, completely healthy.
* Become a president. The system will analyze the Internet to see the tendencies of the world, thus giving you idea for better policies. You receive 50 points to spend on skill trees which the president needs and 3 points to spend to buff expertise on every subject that comes up in need of your ruling.
* Fight for the right cause. (Opens when you do something that the system deems greatly virtuous) The system takes care of you so that you can work efficiently. Now your body adjusts to your timetable, falling asleep quickly, and waking up full of energy (will be followed with debuffs for straining your body after having fought and won, unless you open other perks to offset these effects).

At higher levels (30+) perks become straight-up supernatural. Level 30 is hard to achieve (level 30 in academia, for example, is 10+ published papers with at least 3 significantly influential, and 2+ PhDs.).

* Overall level 30 is a buff on every base stat you had. IQ is increased until it's no less than 170, immune system, health, strength, physical appearance, everything.
* At level 30 in martial arts, you get the lowest-level Sharingan, getting a read on people's moves almost before they are intended.
* At level 30 mindfulness, mindfulness and compassion become a default that is as difficult to stray away from as concentrating on breath once was.
* At level 30 in any field of science, the system tells you dead ends and fields of great potential, effectively making sure not a moment of creative thinking is wasted.",268,14,godtiersuperpowers

Bonus : you can isolate everything you ingest, therefore storing food in a pocket dimension, or even small items (razor blades, matches, and so on). Small items appear in the palm of your hand.

tqc40m,https://www.reddit.com/r/godtiersuperpowers/comments/tqc40m/you_can_save_your_dreams_and_they_exist_irl_as/,"You can save 💾 your dreams, and they exist IRL as alternate dimensions.","Whenever you're dreaming, you can choose to save the world state of your dream and return to it later through a portal whenever you wish. You can't control how your dream behaves anymore though. Once the world state is saved, it functions independently from you. Any rules you set affect you however you wish. So you can do magic and fly and stuff, but you have to figure out how to do it like you ordinarily would in a dream. Great if this sort of thing already comes easily to you.  
You can have as many dreamworlds as you want, and you can leave as many portals open as you want, just.. keep track of them..  
Since you access the dreamworlds through a portal with your physical body, if the dreamworld you created allows it, you can die in there. So be careful.  
Also, the portal can be opened anywhere in the real world, but it's in a fixed point in the dream world and it'll always have a constantly visible landmark (like a giant tree or a perpetual storm or a sky beam). The landmark sets itself automatically based on whatever you were dreaming about.  
Only you can open and close the portal, and it toggles open or closed, so you don't have to concentrate on it. Leaving it open leaves the real world vulnerable to your dreamworld though so again, be careful.  
You can take whatever or whoever you want with you into your dreamworld and leave them in there if you like. Also, if your portal is unattended, anybody can come and go as they please, but they could be stuck in your dreamworld if it closes behind them. And if you didn't know anybody used your portal, this would just be their life now until you opened it again.  
Anybody who visits your dreamworld is subject to the same rules that affect you, so they can all do whatever you can do if they can figure out how. Anything except controlling the portals.  
Time runs exactly the same in your dreamworld as the real world, and it doesn't stop just because you left. It's essentially like resuming a dream you had last night and stuff happened while you were away.  
Lastly, when you die, all your portals remain as you last left them and nobody can do anything about it.",30,5,godtiersuperpowers

tj3fju,https://www.reddit.com/r/godtiersuperpowers/comments/tj3fju/true_vision_you_can_see_people_how_they_truly_are/,True vision: you can see people how they truly are,"You can activate this power at will.

If your power is deactivated your vision is normal, if your power is activated you see the true “colors” of people.

Vision format: you can decide how to see what they are. Whether it shows in the body or mind pointed out or X-rays, or you just feel it, read their minds or see a list laying out their conditions. You can decide how to look at the stuff you want to look at to make it easier to understand. You just think of a layout and you can set the vision like that. You want to see everything like the jumanji character layout? You can. Want to see X-rays like the movie Victor Frankenstein? You can. Want the X-Rays to be like super man’s vision? You can. Whatever you want you see everything that way. Even as antic or modern drawings or their appearance changes to your interpretation of what you imagine a trait is. You can feel things like how mantis from marvel does. A lot of ways

Pin point precision: doesn’t matter what you see or how you see, you know exactly what the person has. you know what specific trait they have so there is no confusion. even if two people with this power may see different things for the same trait (because their layout shows them what they imagine the trait looks) it doesn’t matter what each of them see, they understand the same thing. It is just necessary to know what the trait is, so the power instinctively tells you regardless of what is seen felt or whatever, that’s all just for better understanding or preferred way to empathize with the person. Therefore it doesn’t matter what everyone sees they all understand the same thing from the same people without discrepancy. 

Shared vision: Even if you don’t know terms for something (like a specific disease or medical term) you know what it is from the inside out. You can describe its characteristics easily (like how it looks feels works or interacts with something) even if you don’t know the name of it or you can touch someone to share what you know if you think that’s more practical

Focused or general: you can choose an area  (like physical health, mental health, emotional health, thoughts, memories, etc) and info of just that area will pop out. Everything gets pointed out like drugs used, prosthetics, states of mind, everything depending on the area. You can also just get all the info at once if you are lazy.

Since this is just vision you don’t necessarily know how to treat something, but your better understanding of it does help deal with something and be a better empath. You could study for some medicine with this power by just looking and memorizing but anything external to a body is studied traditionally. Or you could potentially use this power on inorganic things to understand the ins and outs of it on how it works. You can’t replicate anything tho you have to practice and consciously do something to get it right. You can’t see the effects something has on something else preemptively. You can only see in real time but you at least know it now it happened. You don’t get perfect memory tho so study and experiment cause you can’t simulate things using this power",33,0,godtiersuperpowers

You can transform into normal or anthro versions of those 6 Pokémon at any given time. You retain your ability to speak, and you can use 4 moves chosen at random, plus your Signature Move.","You can learn other moves by practicing.

You can change one Pokémon every year once, including the one you got them in.

You start at level 1, and can increase your level by working out as Pokémon, learning as Pokémon or defeating anything as Pokémon.

You cannot die as Pokémon. If you were in such condition that you were to die, you instead revert to your human form, and you cannot use that Pokémon for 24 hours. If you were to die as a human, you instead become a Pokémon you can turn into. You cannot turn into Mewtwo, Mew, Acreus and such other Pokémon, except Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres, but only one of them may be in your loadout at any given time.

XP share can be turned on and off.

You immediately know at least one practical application for your Signature move and at least one other move of your choice from the moves you have for all Pokémon.

If Pokéballs were to be invented, you cannot be affected by them.

You can pick any given Pokémon, not just starters.",31,32,godtiersuperpowers
