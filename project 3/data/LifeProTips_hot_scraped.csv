Edit: Context. I have been work for a state University for almost 20 years. Still have loans. Have made payments for well over ten years after some years of deferral.  I tried to apply previously but due to the complexity would have been difficult to get to a point to qualify and the clock would have restarted and my payments to that point wouldn’t have qualified.

Edit two:  The take away is whether you just started or have been at a qualifying job for years now is the window to get everything qualified and processed during the waiver to get credit for whatever time you already have in service.

ulyg84,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ulyg84/lpt_learning_to_change_established_routines_and/,LPT: Learning to change established routines and habits is extremely valuable.,"They say that good habits are easier to make than bad ones are to break.  The truth is, we will always have to alter our old habits and routines to adapt to change.  If we become skillful at shifting into a new paradigm of thinking or way of performing tasks, we are at a great advantage in an ever changing world.

It boils down to embracing change, instead of resisting it.  Those that are comfortable in the unfamiliar have unlimited possibilities and potential.

Anyone that has learned a new language, particularly later in life, can attest to this idea.  When you learn a new language, you are not just learning a new set of words to express the same thoughts and emotions, you are learning about a whole new way to think and feel.  It's like unlocking a part of your brain that you never knew existed.

One of the hardest things to do is to change the way you do something, especially if you are very good at it and have been doing it for a long time.  It's not even always about getting better at the specific task at hand, but allowing yourself to learn a new way of doing something you familiar with.

The inspiration for this post was the example of typing on a QWERTY keyboard.  If one dares to try to learn a new keyboard layout, they will find it very (very) difficult.  Maybe they won't improve as a typist as a result, but the effort spent in changing how they perform a task so ingrained in the mind and muscle memory will be worth it.  It will exercise new parts of the brain and form new connections in brand new ways.  This is a paradigm shift, not just in the act of typing on a keyboard, but in the ways we think and learn.",2923,42,LifeProTips

If you practice doing something incorrectly, it will become far harder to get better as you have to unlearn bad habits. Be conscious of the right way to do things before devoting time to practice.","This is something I learned while in school for music, but can be applied to any skill that needs time and effort to get better at. You could put in hours and hours of practice and end up only digging yourself deeper into a hole. If you practice a scale wrong 1000 times, it becomes much harder to play it correctly than if you made sure to practice it right in the first place. Be aware of the right way to do things and put effort into getting better in that manner, even if it is harder at first. In the long run, unlearning something wrong takes much, much longer than learning something correctly once. Effective and focused practice is much more important than the amount of time you spend doing so. The person who practices a scale right 10 times is better at it than the person who practiced it wrong 1000 times

Edit: As many are saying, the phrase ""perfect practice makes perfect"" is similar to this. I personally use ""practice makes permanent"" instead as it emphasizes the potential for habits, good or bad, to become solidified.

Edit 2: I should clarify that mistakes are perfectly fine and even encouraged, as long as you can recognize them and take steps to improve them. Also, sucking is absolutely allowed; no one is good at something when they first try or will be able to do everything correctly in practice. The point of ""practice makes permanent"" is to warn against careless practice that may just end up being detrimental in the future if you let too many things slide. It's about identifying, preventing, or ""painting over"" bad habits to ensure you're spending your time effectively. When practicing, be conscious of what and how you are doing and take measures to ensure you are on the right track. Many students and other people learning skills think that time=skill (often learned from phrases like ""practice makes perfect""), when really it's how you spend your time that matters.",28708,456,LifeProTips

I can get almost any stain out and my secret is Lestoil. It's a degreasing solvent and i have used it in the past to get oil and bike grease out of my hands. Automotive mechanics use it too for the same reason. I get grease stains on my clothes sometimes, leaving chapstick in my pocket etc. The thing is this method works well even if you've already dried your clothes in the dryer and ""set"" the stain. This method is ironclad and invincible unlike the stupid baking soda and vinegar methods.


Step 1: Add a tsp of Lestoil on the stain and work it in with your fingers gently. You can add a few drips of water to help work it into a little lather (pro tip work it from both side of the fabric to help penetrate the solvent through. 

Step 2: Leave the garment the fuck alone for like 5 minutes to allow ample time for the Lestoil to absorb and cleave all the grease molecules. 

Step 3: Add a teaspoon amount of DAWN Dishsoap to the area and massage into a generous lather.

Step 4: Rinse or wash the area thoroughly and let air dry or throw it in a wash cycle and let dry. 10/10 times it will vastly reduce the grease/oil stain, and usually erases it completely.

 Sometimes if there's a slight bit left, just repeat the process as necessary. I have gotten the most heinous dried/set olive oil and chapstick stains out of shirts and pants through this way. There are no limitations and it's safe on everything I've ever used it on except for nubuck suede (will strip the water proofing layer and result in slight lightening of the boot). Also wouldn't recommend using it on waxed canvas bags either as that will strip the wax away.",101,33,LifeProTips

Double and triple check that you are fully covered.,"If a cruise ship has to be diverted or a helicopter used to take a guest to land this can easily reach hundreds of thousands of pounds. If a guest didn’t have travel insurance they would be liable for this amount and the expenses could easily bankrupt a family.

In 2018 a family were cruising in the Caribbean with their child Kirsty. Kirsty felt a pain in her head and collapsed into the water. It was estimated that the cost of a medical evacuation to the United States would be $40,000-$50,000.

One night in the cruises medical clinic can cost you $11,000.

If you go on a cruise and don’t have travel insurance you risk losing your cruise fare, paying for large medical bills, and **being unable to get back home (repatriation)** in the event of an emergency. Many cruisers have been left with bills of **thousands of dollars** after a cruise due to not having adequate insurance.

If you are from a country that has a free national health service, or if you have a health insurance policy in a country like the USA this is usually **not valid** when on the ship. Medicare and the European Health Insurance Card **will not** cover you. Even if the cruise starts and finishes in a European port, and only visits European ports along the way, EHIC won’t cover passengers on a boat. This is because EHIC only covers people who are staying in a European country, not on a boat which travels between ports. Many passengers mistakenly believe that EHIC will cover them for trips, falls or illnesses which happen during one of the shore excursions, and again this is not the case, as the passengers “address” is still the ship.

Even if covid feels like it’s over to you or in your country, many countries still have hospitals that are struggelig to work at **pre-pandemic levels**. It can be vitally important to get you to your home country quickly.

The most common reason why insurance requests are denied is because of **undeclared medical conditions**. All illnesses, ongoing tests, and past conditions must be declared. Many examples of passengers who didn’t correctly disclose medical conditions (and as a result invalidated their insurance) can be found. General policies often does not cover anyone with a pre-existing medical condition.

There are many things that could become a medical emergency, even if you are in good health at the moment. Another guest on board the cruise could accidentally cause you harm (people are often drunk or stressed on board), a slip on one of the ships many staircases, a bacteria that makes you unwell in a foreign country.

(or if you're the designated driver)","Many of us are expected to drink socially but may not want to. With friends, coworkers, bosses, family, at a wedding, whatever.

For those who don't know, ginger beer is basically VERY strong ginger ale.

1. Non alcoholic, like root beer.
2. Most bars carry it to use in Moscow mules. (comes in cans and bottles)
3. Significantly cheaper than alcohol so you're not ordering drinks that you barely touch for social acceptance.
4. It tastes good, burns a bit so you *feel* like you're drinking without actually drinking.
5. Many  times the ginger ale on the soda gun at a bar is set way too strong/syrupy to be a better mixer. (So ginger beer is way more reliable)
6. I personally drink ginger beer whenever invited to drink socially with friends (I'm a lightweight). And even keep some in the fridge as my ""beer"" when I get home. (Look in liquor section, not by soda)
7. Ginger is a mild stimulant, so it can perk you up if you need to be awake to drive friends home.
8. Bonus points if it comes in a glass bottle, avoids the subconscious feeling of being left out when all your friends have beers and you have a can of coke or something.

Edit:

After a very good comment from u/WarblingWalrusing, I feel I should clarify something. (That I also didn't realize on first posting)

Wisconsin drinking culture is very strong, and so drinking ginger beer, *for me personally,* is as much about wanting to not ""miss out"" or not feel apart from the group while out at the bars, as it is about avoiding people nagging you or asking constantly why you're not drinking. (Though that is a *big* part too) The ginger burn feels similar enough to vodka burn that you *feel* like you're drinking, but with no hangover. Most of the time I drink ginger beer, it's in place of drinking alcohol socially, so it keeps a similar sense of occasion.  ( I didn't realize until the guy made his comment, so there ya go.)

&#x200B;

Edit2:

I live in the lovely state of Wisconsin, which is the drunkest state in the U.S.. The drinking culture here is very strong and judging from comments, I think people give you considerably more shit here for not drinking than other places, which I didn't take into account.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I don't have a problem saying no to people's face when they try to get me to drink, but when that happens every 10-15 minutes over the span of 3 or 4 hours at a bar, it gets really damn annoying and it's easier to look like you're having a drink so people stop bugging you. (yes complete randoms will ask why you're at a bar not drinking. Don't ask me why, I don't understand it either.)

&#x200B;

Edit3:

I'm seeing a lot of ""this is dumb, just don't drink if you don't want to. Screw anyone for trying to pressure you into drinking"" comments. Which are valid.

I'm seeing equally many comments about how they have been nagged or even politely been asked (repeatedly by many people over the course of an event) why they're not drinking.

It's ok if this LPT doesn't work for you, I get that it doesn't pass the bar of ""holy shit this will improve my life dramatically"" but it's helped me and it seems from comments that some people really agree with it.

If you don't, that's fine. I'm not trying to say you're wrong for disagreeing. I'm just seeing an uncomfortable amount of comments in that vein that are less than polite with other commenters.

This isn’t a catch-all; there are some people deep in the throes of grief or existential woe and they might not be able to take care of a animal. For others, having a pet may provide physical touch, and studies have shown that receiving physical affection (i.e., cuddles and petting) has the same effect that a human touch would have. Many people also struggle with feeling purposeless & that they haven’t much to contribute or that their existence is meaningless. If an animal relies on you for food & shelter, it’s at least way less possible to feel purposeless, as another living creature relies on you to survive.

The lower a food is on the GI, the lower the effect on your blood sugar. The standardized Glycemic Index ranges from 0 to 100.

Foods that have a high GI will be transformed and used at a faster rate by your body, if you dont use them really fast they will be transformed to fat. On the other hand foods with low GI will take substantially longer to be used up and the energy availability can be spread out for a longer time which results in you using the energy more often than not.

Very few friendships are ""love at first sight.""

For example, many adults after moving to a new city will at one point think to themselves, ""I keep trying to make new friends, but when we hang out, it's so awkward! Even if I think they're cool, it's just not the same as hanging out with \[name of old friend from hometown\].""

The only way I've found to fight this bias is to force myself to remember the growing pains of my old friend group.

But forcing myself to remember in detail of how much time and effort it took for me to get comfortable with my friends helps me be patient getting to know people now.

I also enjoy asking people how they met their close friends.

I recently got hired at a new company that will pay me a lot more however as always with starting a new job I will be on probation and I do not like missing work at all during this period.

Normally I try to keep my car all fixed before something major like this however I do have an issue. I recently had to move house as I split with my partner in the span of 1 night and it did take a little tole on my savings.

I have about $390.00 in my more prominent savings for major bills and emergencies and $40 in my other savings account that I use for fun things.

Yesterday, I noticed that my front left car tire is very bald and the other day my car died after listing to music, without the engine, for under an hour. I had to call road service to jump my car and the tech said that my car battery is on its way out. I don't think I have changed my battery in the 4 years that I have had my current car. I am also needing to get a service which tends to bring more car repairs to light.

I would prefer to use the time I have left at the old job as I have a substancial amount of annual leave accrued and do this in one fat go however I don't have the money. The old company will pay out my annual leave which would be enough to knock all car stuff in one go but I won't get that until I start the new job.

I am rattling my brain on how to do this but I am thinking of doing the tires and a wheel alignment first, then getting a battery sorted once I have a little more money (I can call roadside again and ask for a technician with my battery type at any time of day) but that leaves the service. I am not sure how to service my car as most places are not open on Saturday and if they are then they are open for 4 hours that day.

What is your advice?

EDIT: I live in Australia so I have different car places open.",6,16,LifeProTips
uizzic,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/uizzic/lpt_dealing_with_social_anxiety/,LPT: Dealing with Social Anxiety,"Summer is right around the corner, which means your annoying neighbor is planning that community BBQ and your friends want to start partying poolside more often. Social anxiety is KILLER for events like this, especially when they are happening so often and with so many people. Below I'll have a few tips that have helped me with my anxiety. As a preface to all of this, your results will vary. While stuff listed works for me it may not work for you, so don't take this as gospel. 

1. Eat a healthy, non-gas causing, protein dense meal approximately 1-2 hours before the event. 
   
A. Protein is a long burn energy, it takes longer to digest and will keep you more stably energized throughout the whole event rather than carbs which have the potential to make you crash ([Source](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/overview-of-nutrition/carbohydrates,-proteins,-and-fats#:~:text=Because%20proteins%20are%20complex%20molecules,There%20are%2020%20amino%20acids))
   
B. eating 1-2 hours in advance is to allow your glucose levels to return to normal. Eating spikes your glucose which causes elevated heart rate and potentially addition anxiety.  [Source](https://www.knowdiabetes.org.uk/blog/those-bothersome-blood-sugar-spikes-after-meals/#:~:text=Why%20do%20people%20get%20blood,working%20to%20lower%20the%20spike) 
   
C. the non-gas is obvious...

2. Arrive early enough to be part of the initial crowd, but don't be so early that you are the first arriver. 
   
A. Having a smaller crowd helps alleviate some of the stress since there's fewer people (duh). Try chatting with a few people and see if you can get engaged in enough to pass the time. If you're invested in the conversation while the crowd is building up, it is possible that you'll be less stressed since you already feel comfortable with someone there and have been comfortable there the entire time. 
   
B. being the first arriver can still spike anxiety since you are now alone with a bunch of people who might not have been ready for people to show up yet. 

3. Drive yourself to the event if at all possible. If not, make sure you have a way to reliably escape 
   
A. your friend that carpooled you there probably doesn't have the same social battery as you. Chances are they will want to leave either early (pulling you out of the situation you did enjoy) or stay longer (keeping you in a drained state when you want to be home).

4. Lastly, it's ok to say no sometimes. You don't need to go to every event you are invited to and you owe nobody your time.

If you have a rough outline, some manner of plan for what to do - even if it doesn’t happen for years - then you won’t be as taken off guard when it happens. It doesn’t have to be elaborate. 
For example: exercise, shower, breakfast, read a book, lunch, vacuum, TV, dinner, sleep.
If it has to do with expected loss or your person being away and leaving the bed empty, or even going through a divorce or breakup, make a plan for sleeping. Maybe you will do it in a different place (like on the couch), have a specific routine that helps you settle down, whatever it may be.

It's polite to underestimate people's age and weight when these things come up. In the same way, I think you should overestimate the person's job importance or status.

Like if you think someone is a grad student you should ask ""Are you a professor?"" 

If you're not sure whether someone is a nurse or a doctor I think you should ask ""Are you the doctor?""
[Negative opinions dismissing nurses as low class or low importance are obviously wrong and disgusting, but the doctor's role does carry an additional social prestige which is the core idea here]

 If someone might be a normal worker but might also be the person interviewing you for a job you should ask ""Hi are you [Boss' Name]? I'm here to interview with them.""

As soon as you know you are getting pulled over, immediately drive to the next SAFE place to stop and park. Your safety and the cops safety are priority number one. If it takes a little bit to find a safe part of the road or a parking lot, that is okay. I always try to get off the highway if I can. Go exactly the speed limit, they won't pull you over. But try to pull over in less than a minute.

When you stop, put down at least your window halfway to 3/4. If you have others in the car, put down their windows too. Turn off your car, put keys on dash and hands up on top of steering wheel. This again puts the cop at ease since you are signaling you aren't going to drive off. Get license and registration. Bonus points if you can have them ready before he gets to the window.

Be polite, honest, forgiving, accepting and most importantly do everything they say. It's okay to slightly embellish on where you are going and coming from to put them in your shoes. Stay calm through all that and when they walk back from their vehicle there's a good chance you'll have a warning; if you weren't doing anything too crazy. These steps have worked well for me during the past 20 years in Maryland and Virginia.

I'm looking for LPT for traveling to London, specifically Zone 1, as this summer I'm taking a trip there for a week and staying with my sister. However, I've been to London before, for a 5-day trip in 2019, so I have some experience using public transportation, getting around the center on foot, and finding cool places to visit and pubs to crawl about. Thus, I'll try to start with a few LPT I've come up with on my own, but I'm still using an LPT Request flair to encourage more suggestions from locals or experienced travelers, as I've only visited 3 major European cities until now. 

&#x200B;

For starters, walking around London is probably the best way to see what the city is about, as the varied and impressive architecture (especially for those from Eastern Europe or abroad), myriad of parks, restaurants, shops, and pubs are all around town, and while using apps to find the highest-rated spots is great, I suggest simply finding your own adventures in the city.

&#x200B;

A sub-tip for walking around town will be leaving your larger bag or backpack at home and only using a smaller one for money, water, charger, and ID, or if you don't stay in Zone 1, in one of the storage services that are all across London, with the one I used being [https://stasher.com/luggage-storage/london/kings-cross](https://stasher.com/luggage-storage/london/kings-cross). 

&#x200B;

As far as travel by train or tube is concerned, getting an Oyster card is crucial, and I'm lucky I can use my sister's (although I don't condone using other people's cards). 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, visiting Museums in London is a must. Most of them are free, and the British Empire had certainly amassed an impressive collection of artifacts from all over the world. What I don't recommend doing if you are on a limited budget is going to the more famous tourist attractions, such as the London Eye or Madame Tussaud's, with the former having been especially disappointing and overpriced on my first trip. However, if you absolutely want to visit these, try buying a multi-ticket that comes in cheaper than paying separately. 

&#x200B;

Some other tips include NOT playing street games that are usually scams (I speak Romanian, so I could gather what the scammers were talking about and doing while observing them), opting for fast food joints instead of restaurants if you only need a quick snack, to save money, as well as trying craft beers while pub crawling to get the best out of local types of beers. 

&#x200B;

In any case, these are some tips I've come up with after my first trip. I am very curious to read many others from you guys, so I'm even better prepared next time I visit London!",16,3,LifeProTips

This is a sign of stability and courage, not weakness.","As a prior social worker and someone who deals with mental health, in a nutshell, I went through Hell and back the last several months. Not a lot of people knew what to do, who to call, how to help.

Sure, I wrote stuff on a whiteboard but that gets messy after a bit. Now that I'll be living on my own, I felt it was necessary to make this manual. 

Maybe the manual will help when I'm spiraling but I see it as a tool when others want to help but don't know how. Some people, for example, think calling the cops is always the immediate response. For me personally, if the cops were called and showed, I'd probably panick and fight. 

In my manual, it would explain the true and only reasons to call the police (I don't have to get into that) and what signs attributed to that call. 

To further bat this home, due to my conditions, I have bouts of suicide. No, I am not suicidal, but when I am crashing or stuck in auto pilot, sometimes I say creepy things. Someone could jump the gun and think, SHIT, Ares2890 is gonna kill himself. No, no-no. Based on my therapy and my long standing relationship with trauma, saying that with suicide in it or involved comes from a stress, fight or flight response. 

Never meant to write this much, but what I am saying is if you love yourself and want to always stay healthy, make a guide, manual, general tips even, on how to help you get through your moment of darkness. 

We all deserve help and deserve to receive help we feel is right. Be an advocate for yourself and make this booklet for yourself. When you man or woman comes over, friend, family, your in tears panicking, shits broken, they want to help save you - you point them to the booklet. 

Don't let anyone see this willy nilly, this is personal, only tell people you trust. Because when you write this you are not writing 'when I am sad' or 'when I feel lonely', you could but remember emergency.

Ares2890 said he wanted to kill himself, now what
Ares2890 is crying and circling back to the same thought like he is stuck on it
Ares2890 melted down 
Ares2890 talks about suicide 
Ares2890 feels unsafe but doesn't want to go the hospital or receive intervention


These are just topics I have thought of for my manual.

If it helps people out with mental health or being afraid to admit it, I am bi polar disorder type 1 with ADHD, and bipolar depression.

In a lot of cases, fresh broccoli is sold at a flat rate (i.e. $2.99/ct) as 2-3 stalks rubber banded together.  That's considered 1ct (1 count).  

I keep seeing a non-zero number of people ring this up by how many stalks are in the bunch. So oftentimes they're charging themselves 2-3 times the actual price of the bunch. ...which, man...if you're paying $6 for 2 stalks of broccoli...that's pretty cost prohibitive.  Check your Instacart orders too if that's a service you use.  I usually shop myself so I've only used it a couple times, but both times the shoppers didn't get this (not sure how common the mistake is).  I get it, this is kind of a dumb LPT, but I wouldn't have made it if I hadn't seen it for myself...a surprising number times.

Not sure if there are other common items (produce or otherwise) sold like this where people are accidentally ripping themselves off.  I just eat a lot of broccoli I guess.

You should approach life with a long term plan for finding two ends of the rainbow: the first one is to build a life where you can enjoy relationships that are built on respect. The second one is to find your Ikigai.

**LIFE**

Kindergarten, school and college are opportunities to learn social skills, to establish healthy boundaries and to start developing a “*spidey sense*” that you will use to weed out toxic people out of your life, and that you will use to funnel people with a good head on their shoulders, whom you can nurture a relationship with. Life is too short to spend being bitter or resentful, so you should learn to avoid toxic persons pre-emptively, before they can do any harm to you.

If you don’t know how to recognise a good friend, here are some *green flags* to look for. The reverse of the medal is that you also have to look in the mirror, and ask yourself what you need to allow in your life to fit [the description](https://medium.com/@clusters_insp/the-guide-to-setting-healthy-boundaries-1ec789528788):

* Trust
* Accountability
* Safety
* Honesty
* Support
* Cooperation

Had I had this concept spelled out to me in bold letters at an early age, I would had dared more and experienced more. I feel I might sometimes have let my insecurities and my self-consciousness allow me to miss out on some parts of life. But at the same time, I am happy where I am now, and I would not have ended up here if I had made different choices. You live and learn, but it’s better to learn from the mistakes of others than to learn from your own.

**WORK**

Ikigai is a Japanese philosophy that suggests that you will [find your true purpose](https://studygram.me/blog/how-to-choose-your-college-major-according-to-the-japanese-philosophy-ikigai) when you find an occupation that ticks these four boxes. It looks much deeper than simply *following your passion* or""*following your dream*:

* You are good at it
* You actually enjoy doing it
* The world needs it
* You can make a living out of it

It is quite a conundrum to figure out at an early age what you want to do in life. I picked studies that were already a niche, so I had to work hard to get a career, but fortune smiles on me and within 8 years I landed the job I had always dreamed about. Although, I hadn’t considered that it came with a glass ceiling.

So if I could speak to a younger version of me, I would recommend to choose studies that could still land me in that field, but that had a broader reach and opened slightly more possibilities, horizontally but also vertically.

I think that having relationships that are built on respect, beats having a work that you enjoy, hands down. If you have to prioritise between the two, good relationships will make you more grounded in your life, and it can be enough to pull you through a mediocre job.

Inversely, having mediocre relationships will probably make you feel mediocre emotionally, even if you landed your dream job. You will be tempted to put all your value in the job, but the fact remains that a career is something that you can loose overnight. If you have fulfilling relationships, it means your friends value and respect you for who you are, and that cannot easily be lost overnight.

---

I think if you keep these two chart in mind, chase relationships that are built on mutual respect and search for your Ikigai, your life will NOT feel like it is missing something.",33,7,LifeProTips

Some of us may have some anxiety or fear about aging into our older decades.

In my line of work as a medical doctor, I meet many folks who are in their 70s to 80s. All have varying levels of health and functioning. A few ""exceptional"" ones that stand out to me are happy, healthy, and highly functioning.

I started asking these individuals and couples for their ""secrets"" of aging well. These were their most common advice:

1. They take good care of their brain and their bodies and have developed or learned habits to continue this for all of their lives. They sleep as much as they can, they nourish themselves well, they still learn things, and most of all, they spend time having fun or enjoying being present in their surroundings.
2. They don't neglect their most important relationships (typically long-term marriages or long-term partnerships). The ones with long-term relationships are still having sex with one another and eye each other with joy and glee when they ask for a Viagra prescription. They tend to make each other smile and laugh, even during a short office visit.
3. Not all of them exercise, but all of them have reasons to keep moving their bodies. These are usually jobs and/or hobbies that keep their bodies moving in positions other than the usual sitting or standing or laying down during most of their waking moments.
4. Most common and most important of all, they wake up each morning with a sense of purpose, or duty to a service, that they are passionate about, even after they retire. They never stop serving their partners, their family members, or their communities.

May you all advance into your 70s to 80s with as much functioning and enjoyment out of life as possible!

Much Love

Income insurance) BEFORE you are successful at conceiving. You cannot sign up if you are already pregnant.","This is just one of the things I have learned about what to think about when expanding the family, and it seems like a much bigger deal in a country that will in some cases give you up to 24 weeks protected leave but NO income for those 24 weeks.

Why do you become ineligible for signing up for this insurance once pregnant? No idea. However, you do, and you will most likely be in dire need of this insurance. It costs a few dollars per month - I think mine is $60/month, but it’ll be so worth it when I have my full post-tax income after giving birth.

My short-term disability insurance is through American Fidelity and will cover my income, after taxes, for 12 weeks. I am in Oregon and FMLA (family leave) is 6-12 weeks and bonding time, OFLA, is another 12 weeks. Both are protected by law and you cannot be fired because of taking them.

They decided to tell their problems to you because they trust you and hope that in doing so, their problem becomes less of a problem.
